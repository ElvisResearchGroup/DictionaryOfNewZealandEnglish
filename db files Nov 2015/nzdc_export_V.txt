Quote: There's a red-pink wildflower currently dominating hillsides all over Wellington. Preferring sunny spots on clay banks or cracks in concrete, with reddish blooms made up of a cloud of tiny florets, it goes by many names including Centranthus ruber, Bouncing Bess, Drunken Sailor, Red spur, Spur valerian, Red valerian or False valerian.... In fact, Centranthus and true valerian are not closely related botanically; Centranthus probably gained the names because of a similarity between the flowers of the two plants.

Theorigin and dating of the word are doubtful. There is a similar word poddy calf for a hand-fed calf, recorded in Australia from last century.

Vol / Page: 1/291
Edition:
Quote: Amongst the damp moss at the root of the rata trees, in the shady forests not far from Auckland,and also in various parts of the Northern Island, are found those extraordinary productions called vegetable caterpillars - the hotete of the natives. In appearance, the caterpillar differs but little from that of the common privet sphinx-moth, after it has descended to the ground previously to its undergoing the change into the chrysalis state. But the most remarkable characteristic of the vegetable caterpillar is, that every one has a very curious plant, belonging to the fungi tribe, growing from [292] the .us;anus; this fungi varies from three to six inches in length, and bears at its extremity a blossom-like appendage, somewhat resembling a miniature bulrush, and evidently derives its nourishment from the body of the insect. This caterpillar, when recently found, is of the substance of cork; and it is discovered by the natives seeing the tips of the fungi, which grow upwards. They account for this phenomenon by asserting that the caterpillar, when feeding upon the rata-tree overhead, swallows the seeds of the fungus, which take root in the body of the insect, and germinate as soon as it retreats to the damp mould beneath, to undergo its transformation into the pupa state. Specimens of these vegetable caterpillars have been transmitted to naturalists in England, by whom they have been named  Sphoeria Robertii.[check spgs ??? see under

I think it is a pity that our Transactions should be disfigured by a vulgar corruption, however common.

Quote: Schoolboy rugby is reported to have given us the charming neologism "versing". Cameron Williamson writes that his nine-year old son's mates are in the habit of bursting in through the back door, yelling, "Who are we versing on Saturday?" When they look up the draw to see which club is to play "versus" whom, attention is likely to turn to Gameboy or Playstation, in which contestants are locked in battle, "versing" each other to death.

Quote: "It will be agreed by all medical authorities that the speed at which successive draughts of alcohol are consumed is a more potent factor in conducing to inebriacy than the actual quantity taken, and if some means could be devised whereby the concentrated 'vertical swilling' which now takes place could be avoided a reduction in drunkenness would inevitably follow.   The system of bar parlours such as obtain in English and the Continent are designed to discourage this objectionable vertical drinking, but it would seem to be unavoidable if the bulk of the public are obliged to satisfy their requirements between 5 and 6 p.m."

On either side of this, arranged with all a Scotch gardener's love of symmetry, are sitting-room, dining-room, bedrooms and  kitchen ... the evolutionary starting point of the New Zealand villa must have been the tin-lined packing case in which the pioneer settler imported his goods and chattels.

Quote: The villa is a strange contraption, the work of 19th-century building companies enraptured with the possibilities of mass production... Villas are loved and despised in about equal numbers. Two groups for whom the villa has always worked well are flatting students, where everyone has a room of their own and a communal space for meals, and Polynesian families, where the number of people in a house is often in flux... Met with city regulations that required villa-ness and a family to whom the soon-to-be-demolished villa remained well-suited. Walker responded by taking the villa concept apart and re-assembling it as a contemporary home... To the rear are the kitchen and living spaces, now interconnected and made open to a deck - that contemporary re-think of the traditional verandah.

Quote: In Wellington, used of the shopping area(s) in Karori, and occasionally in Ngaio, but there I think it means the whole suburb.  Until c1933 I had never heard  village used in New Zealand - always town, township, or settlement. In 1953 i heard it from one or two who were English, or who had travelled in England and affected English ways. I have heard it recently used by New Zealanders born and bred referring to small townships, but they do not sound at home with it and use it in default of a better word. It may come in.

Definition:a) a populated area in the country, which is smaller than a town. b) its inhabitants. c) in New Zealand a shopping centre; the centre of a rural town, or a cluster of shops outside the centre of a city. -->[AND 1. obs a small (rural) settlement 1803-1907 2. a cluster of aboriginal dwellings] often with def. art. THE VILLAGE, a modern usage (to be distinguished from the occasional very early British usage of emigrants), orig. deprecatingly and mainly humorously of a township or settlement by those living in the countryside outside its boundaries, or by semi-permanent residents (e.g. week-enders, bachers, etc). For example, Paraparaumu `beach' residents (once mainly a weekend population) refer to the original township on the main road as `The Village' and have done so since at least 1941; similarly for Johnsonville, originally a town, now a suburb of Wellington: their rugby supporters would call (c1950s) `Come on the village!'; the Taupo township (now near-city) was in the 1960s referred to by the large seasonal lakeside holiday population at least as Taupo village. -->The usage was probably fairly popular by at least 1940, and is now common, often being transferred to, for example, the `down-town' or shopping area of  a city by those living in the suburbs (e.g. `Are you coming into the village tonight to the pictures?'); or, specifically, of shopping areas, and now custom-built shopping-complexes in the suburbs (e.g. `You go up Karori Road past the first village, and just before you come to the second, turn off right ...'; or ``Marsden Village' is the name of the recently-opened shopping area in Karori.')

The features of the system were, originally, the possession of a small farm, not exceeding 50 acres in extent, held under a perpetual lease for terms of thirty years, with recurring valuations at the end of each terms. ...Residence and improvement of the soil were compulsory.
