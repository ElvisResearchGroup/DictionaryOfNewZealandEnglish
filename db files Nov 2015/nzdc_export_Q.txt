I do not live by stealing.' `Quarter' has, of late years, become a proverbial term; the Government Native Assessors, being paid once a quarter, talk commonly of getting their quarters. The Kingites despise these Maoris who have been bribed over, and hate and deride the `quarter' as conclusive of all that is bad. Hanauru, the King's great priest, who was present, pointed out how he could go about anywhere, all the year round, and wanted no quarter.

This was very commendable and necessary in some instances, but where a township, as sometimes happened, did not `go off' at the sale, or if it did go off, was never subsequently embellished with a building of any kind, the effect had something of the ludicrous about it - for while settlement went on around the `township,' and the land was cleared and occupied, the `town' itself remained a solid block of standing bush, and the absentee owners of its acre or quarter-acre sections were only reminded of their possessions by the persistent recurrence of the notices to pay rates.

Quote: Finlay Macdonald and Grahame Anderson.. completely miss the problem of the mythical Queen's Chain. In 1840 Queen Victoria instructed Governor Hobson to "set aside for recreation and amusement ... on the sea coast or in the neighbourhood of navigable streams ... reserves" - and "we do strictly enjoin and require you that you do not on any account, or on any pretence whatsoever, grant, convey or demise to any person or persons any of the lands specified as fit to be reserved as aforesesaid, nor permit or suffer any such lands to be occupied by any private person for any private purposes". This admirable instruction was not adopted until the 1892 Land Act, by which time much land adjoining riverbeds and the coast had been taken up. Since then.. the few lengths where the Queen's Chain was set aside are now in the riverbeds or out to sea, because they were fixed on survey plans and not moveable.
