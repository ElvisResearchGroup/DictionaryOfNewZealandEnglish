Quote: The Oar-fish, 12 to 20 feet long, with a high, flame-tipped head-crest (the elongated fin rays) is probably the sea-serpent of repute. Its pelvic fins are narrow, elongated processe, hence the name Oar-fish. The Deal-fish is much smaller, but of the same type, but we know very little of the habits of either of them.

Quote: Are you a `type' or an `odd-bod'? It was several days before I fathomed this out. The cry would go up, `Ruapehu types arriving, get cracking.' The best club cups would be sorted out, an official or prominent member would greet the new-comers show them proudly over the house and dispense tea and hospitality with a cordial air. Then I'd hear, `Odd bods coming up the track'. A member would supervise his arrival, see that no one entered the club-room with nailed boots on, and offer a cup of tea, but there was not that ostentatious display of club china, `eats' and cordiality. I found that a `type' is a member of a recognised club, and therefore someone to be treated with respect. An `odd bod' is also a tramper or mountaineer, but of no specified breed, though entitled to shelter. The same law holds for  bush and mountain: hospitality must be dispensed for folk of the right ilk, so that the billy is always on the boil. But tourists ! Well, I'd just hate to be a tourist ! They were treated with the loftiest contempt. I suppose I came under the heading `odd bod' vouched for by a `type'. ...

Quote: Off-sider.- Assistant. Now mostly applied to the slushy, or cook's mate, but the term may have originated with the old bullock drivers, who drove their teams from the near side. I have oftenhelped the Glentanner bullock driver across the Tasman, by riding on the off side with a whip to keep the bullocks up stream; and he always asked if I would `off-side' for him. I have heard a bullocky speak of his dog as his  o.s.

Road-making on a 50/50 basis with the local bodies, ohu or mahi-apu [ed fn: A group of volunteer workers] in relation to scrub-cutting, bush felling, splitting posts and battens, gave ample evidence of self-help.

Quote:  [Old Identity] was the name applied by the people of Victoria, who flocked hither in thousands on the discovery of gold, to those who had been in the province before that time. Those honest folks, the tenour of whose ways had previously been very even, were greatly started by this immense and sudden influx of population. 16,000 persons landed in three months, and everythig went up to worse than famine prices. It is alleged that one minister actually prayed that the stream of rogues and vagabonds which was flowing into the country might be stayed, but this I believe to have been a base invention of the `new iniquity', as the new-comer were nicknamed.  The term `old identities' took its origin from an expression in a speech made by one of the members of the  Provincial Council, Mr. E.B. Cargill, who, in speaking of the new arrivals, said that the early settlers should endeavour to preserve their old identity. The strangers, who were inclined to laugh at the aboriginals as a set of old stagers, caught up the phrase, and dubbed them `old identities'. Acomic singer helped to perpetuate the name by writing a song the refrain of which was something in this style -  `Touch not that shaky jetty, / Let that old post-office be, / That's one way to preserve / Your old identity'.  So that anything effete came to be styled a regular `old identity'. So much did the name come to be a term of reproach among the Australian diggers that the barracouta 'thyrsites atum), a rather coarse fish, very abundant at certain seasons, and which was consequently very cheap, and a great favourite with boarding-house keepers, was christened by them `the old identity'

Quote: The origin of the descriptive term `Old Identities' has been involved in some doubt. Not only is it a convenient one, but it is now widely used throughout the Colonies to [202] denote the oldest inhabitants, as distinguished from the newcomers, or `new iniquities.' Mr. Charles R. Thatcher, who was the son of a natural history collector at Brighton, and was about his father's business, came to Dunedin with the great rush in February, 1862, and gave vocal entertainments which were highly relished. He was a clever improviser, and nightly sang in rough verse to delighted audiences the events of the day, which then, though trivial, were numerous enough. Mr. E. B. Cargill was seeking a seat in the Council, and addressing the electors, regretted that the old settlers were being thrown into the shade, and that to prevent this they must make a strong and united effort. This was food for Thatcher, who thereupon brought down the house with a witty song of eight verses, each of which terminated with the refrain of `The Old Identity.' Thus:- `Does he wish each brother Scotchman/ To come out in a kilt - / To kittle up the chanter,/ And go in for a lilt?/ With bare legs in Otago/ How very cold 'twould be!/ But it's one way of preserving/ The Old Identity.' Yes, it did seem as though the `new iniquity' were, like a flowing tide, to obliterate the `old identity.' But no such catastrophe happened.

Quote:  Many large Snapper are caught with a peculiar hump on the head which is caused by a thickening of the frontal bone. When a fisherman lands such a fish he immediately states: `I've caught an old man Snapper' under the erroneous impression it is an old male fish. I have often dissected these `old man' Snappers and found that there were as many female as male fish with this conspicuous bony knob. The name `old man Snapper' comes from the likeness to the face of an old man with bulbous red nose, a short clipped moustache and tight upper lip, which can be seen in the illustration.

Quote: The Dialogue game of Caricature includes The Old Lady from Botany bay. In this game the children must not laugh at the old lady although she does her best to provoke them to do so. It has been known as Diggley Bones (Auckland [19]00), An Old Man from B.B. (Palmerston [19]10), An Old Lady from Poverty bay (Wellington [19]00). It is widely reported in the last twenty years. The Old Lady comes up to the children and says `Here comes the Old Lady from Botany Bay, and what [433]have you got to give her today. You must neither laugh nor smile but say ----'. Then the child would say something funny but try not to laugh when doing so. ... (Nelson [19]49).

The games were known as Fives, Tens, Sevens, and Walls and have been recorded more often since under the names O'Leary or Sevens. Before 1920 there is only one report of the game being played with a rhyme, and this was a rhyme more often used in skipping.

Quote: Under this arrangement, a landless man, who had enough capital to buy sheep, could graze them on another man's property. Usually, the grazier took one-half of the annual wool clip of the 'terms' sheep and one-third of the total increase at the end of the period. J D Ormond, before his purchase of Wallingford, grazed sheep 'on terms' or 'thirds' on the property of Richard Collins, a Wairarapa sheepfarmer.

Quote: As the quartz mines began to decline in output and could no longer pay a large wage sheet, it became the custom to let them on tribute, by which parties of men were given the right to mine and raise quartz from the resultant crushing, of which a proportionate share of the gold went to the company. This system might also apply to old workings of mines in actual work, but in most of these cases the tributors followed a thin but valuable lead, which might not be much thicker than a finger, but so rich as to be worth tunnelling or working as a tribute, in which the golden lead was pursued on an upward slope. It used to be rather shrewdly suspected that tributors were not `working on the blind' but had as former employees of the company marked a lead and covered the same by a piece of mine timber or rubble till a later date give them the chance to profit by their knowledge. Many of the tributors did exceedingly well; they had nothing except their labour to lose, and the company got some profit on a good lead, and so `where's the harm?'

Hunt about wallaby-hunting in Australia being what gum-digging is in NZ] As the hunter was of necessity [?out] a good deal at night, `on the wallaby' came by degrees to mean - according to the natural tendency of language to degenerate, when associated with low ideas - `making a night of it', having a `spree', being drunk; ... But to the rest of us `on the wallaby' means taking off the harness, and letting ourselves run free a bit; putting aside the mask and coming down from the stage; loosening the grip of fashion and returning for a while to the simplicity of life ... We crave to go somewhere `on the wallaby'.

Quote: Traditionally the shift to once a day is generally used as a signal to the herd that drying off time is not too far off. The expectation is that once a day will initiate a reduction in milk production. However, there is also the obvious positive side to once a day. Once a day will increase cow condition (or decrease condition loss.)

This does not cover the common NZ one-way bridge, across which a vehicle may travel in either direction unless there is opposing traffic. That is, it can be crossed only one way at a time. Although the distinction is a fine one, it seems real. Possibly the term <i>one-way bridge</i> is itself distinctive NZE. The latest NZ Road Code uses the term <i>one-lane bridge</i>.

The opalescent display of colours left no doubt in my mind as to the appropriateness of the common name. The abovementioned anglers and fishermen had various names to distinguish this fish from Opal-fish - which are as follows: Bluey, Blue-cap, Blue-Bonnet, which I have used.

Quote: The petrol was discovered about six miles down the Amyntaion-Servia road and as soon as the lorries were loaded our drivers turned their attention to the ration section of the dump. They were shown where the luxuries were stacked and told to help themselves. It was their first experience of what was to be known later as an 'open slather' and many of them were pink with excitement as they scrambled among the stacks, breaking open cases of tinned fruit, tinned vegetables, pickles, jam, tobacco, cigarettes. You just helped yourself. It was a childhood dream come true and for a quarter of an hour they behaved like greedy small boys. They stuffed their blouses with tins and threw cases on top of the loads of petrol.Often, in the days that lay ahead, we were to be wet and cold, sick and sorry, tired and frightened-never hungry. Empty and half-empty tins of peas and beans and pears and raspberries were to mark the passage of our convoys. It is probably fair to say that from the day of the first 'open slather' until the day we left Greece most of us over-ate.

Here at last was an oven designed for New Zealand conditions; its fire box was wide and shallow to draw in the extra air needed for lignite coal, and it did not need to be bricked in. The No. 1 Orion soon outsold all its competitors, ..., and was built substantially the same way until the 1930s.

Quote: ...it is worthy of notice, that the colonists, soon after the formation of all the settlements, acquired distinguishing epithets; thus there was an Auckland cove, a Wellington swell, a Nelson snob, a Taranaki exquisite, an Otago cockney, and a Canterbury pilgrim. These epithets, almost already forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some  peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; and the origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation.

Quote: The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australianusage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally thewriter has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even inadvertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

Quote: The crown was called a bull, a cartwheel, a caser, five  bob, and most familiar of all a dollar, the latter dating from the time when the rate of exchange was four US dollars to the pound. The only instance recorded of  Cockney rhyming slang term for a coin is Oxford scholar, the derivation from dollar being obvious. The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull, half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and two-and-a-buck. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only  two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

The brown could be due to the oxidation of pyrite to limonite and haematite in the rock. Near the water-level there was sometimes a zone of semi-sulphides where the ore might be enriched by leaching downward of some of the values.

Quote: The critics will no doubt note that to oozle and to trickle, which denoted much slower modes oflocomotion, were comparatively little [30] used, and will not be surprised that Wellington  trampers are sometimes afflicted with perspidrip, or describe themselves as  jagged. Jagged (one syllable), worn out by exertion, exhausted,  no doubt has some relation to the English dialect on the jag, a  drunken spree, and the American jagged, tipsy, and also owes something to jiggered.
