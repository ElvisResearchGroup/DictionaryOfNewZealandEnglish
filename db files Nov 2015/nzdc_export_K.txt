Quote:  New Zealanders are outdoors people and part of many Kiwis' upbringing includes going fishing, for kahawai off the beach, rocks or local wharf. Grandparents and even parents remember giant schools of kahawai churning up the sea within a stone's throw of the shore. That abundance and the fish's fighting qualities made the kahawai the "people's fish".

This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai.

Quote:  When in a hurry, or feeling orthographically tired, he [the southerner] calls the big manuka `kaikatoa.' A southern Maori once said to me:- `We did not pronounce the word manuka like some northerners who throw the accent forward and say `man-u-ka,' nor like the bushmen, who say `m'nooka,' but about halfway between these two pronouncing each part clearly as mah-nook-a.' Unless my hearing deceives me this throws the emphasis on the central syllable while leaving the first syllable clearly pronounced. it is a remarkable fact that while the manuka is so common its name is so seldom used in the composition of place-names.

Quote:  Kate Mitchell raises an fascinating point about the phrase "the big kahuna"... Where it gets interesting, though, is finding references to similar words beginning with t- instead of k-, the sort of consonant transliteration not uncommon in Polynesian languages... Throughout the eastern Pacific the words tahunga and tahuna crop up for people with special powers such as priests and sorcerers. it doesn't take much imagination to see a relationship with our own Maori tohunga, the word for a priest or specially skilled person.

the relative worth of objects made of the <i>pounamu, </i> the nephrite so much prized for pendants, <i>mere</i>, and adzes. Most prized was the <i>kahurangi</i> stone, bright green, translucent, hard and clear; the<i> inanga</i> variety perhaps comes next, with its white milky-veined appearance, [389] followed by the <i>kawakawa</i>, dark olive-green, dull and opaque. ... <i>Tangiwai</i> (`tear drop'), <i>bowenite</i>, a softer stone of a clear pale green, with the appearance of drops of water in the texture, was less esteemed, though more beautiful in the European eyes, whilst <i>kahotea</i>, green, spotted or streaked with black, was an inferior type, and was used for small chisels, and for objects of subordinate interest.

Quote:  There is a feeling that kai tiaki, tohunga and multiple gods are still more things that Pakeha have taken away from Maori and that have to be got back... "The trouble is, when a Maori talks about Maori spirituality, it tends to get abused ... But i'm not sure that [kai tiaki] is an awful lot different from the notion of an angel." <i>ibid.</i> 23 "When a Maori leader like Dover or Tariana says they are going back to consult their people at home, they don't necessarily just mean <i>those</i> people. They mean ancestors ... kai tiaki."

They resemble a pipi in shape,though they possess a black horny covering - the periostracum - like a marine mussel. Kakahi once formed extensive beds in New Zealand lakes and rivers, living shallowly buried in sand or mud, like pipi, rather than attached to rocks in the manner of most marine mussels.

Quote:  Kamai is called black birch in the Catlin River District and Southland, which name is given on account of a supposed resemblance to the `birches', or more correctly, `beeches', a number of which occur in that locality. i cannot understand how such an idea could have originated, for except in the ease of the bark of one there is not the slightest resemblance between the birches and kamai. Whatever be the reason, the misapplication of names is complete, for the birches are still commonly called kamai in Southland.

Anyone with an inkling of understanding of Pacific island culture will see that it is a blend of haka (New Zealand), cibi (Fiji), kailao (Tonga) and siva tau (Samoa).  Possibly the sad truth behind all this carry-on is that those in the so-called home countries simply don't like seeing the natives stamping their feet and standing strong.

Naturally, the easiest-shorn sheep -- `bare-bellies' and `bare points' -- are selected first. it is amusing to watch the tactics of some of the shearers to dodge the Kapara (Cobbler) the last sheep in the pen, which, presumably, is the worst shearing sheep of the lot.

The native name of the tree is kapuka. it is commonly called broad-leaf by the white men there. The kohai is also a very common tree in the woods, and grows to a large size.

karaka
Homonym Number:  1
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:<i>karaka</i> is the chief modern name among New Zealanders; others are obsolesc. Among the more precise and knowedgeable people it is n1. pronounced [k'rak a] but the old anglicisations ['kraeka] [ka'raeka] are still very common, especially in country districts and in the bush. Early spgs (<i>cracker, kraka</i>) point to these pronunciations; even as accurate an observer as E. J. Wakefield would spell it `kraka' (perhaps [krak a]), although in his `Adventures in NZ' it is always written <i>karaka.</i> cf <i>cracker, caraceer;</i> a spreading tree common in coastal areas and producing orange fruit, the kernels of which are poisonous unless soaked and cooked [Maori]; cowtree, New Zealand laurel (kopi, Chatham island).

Notes: The application of the word to public worship is, of course, modern.': the noun is recorded in Maori contexts only, e.g. 1874 Johnstone, Maori 193 note - incantations - In their use of this word the Maoris had no idea of prayer, and it is a mistake to attach that meaning to karakia. The verb is recorded in English form, and is mainly confined to in ???19th century use.

Quote:  Otane was one of a series of highly successful wheat cultivars Dr McEwan, always thinking a decade ahead, bred while working for the DSiR. Others.. were Karamu (1979), Rongotea and Oroua (both 1979). They were grown from Southland to Waikato, as was Endeavour (1994). He was best known for his work in wheat but he also worked in oats and barley, naming one, a black feed oat, Finlay, after an early All Black, Jack Finlay.

The most commonly used species for Japanese nori is Porphyra tenera, whereas our karengo is Porphyra columbina .. But to be honest, i've tried karengo fresh, dried, cooked with orange juice, diluted with kumara, disguised with parmesan - and, still, i couldn't honestly say i adore its flavour, which, to me, has rather too strong an iodine edge to be delicious.

Definition:The word in this sense appears only in Torlesse's writings from Cant., the second 1849 form if genuine represents an uncertain hearing of Maori [r]. The plant denoted would seem to be rather the BUSH LAWYERT than MATAGOURI, and if so may represent a hearing of a *<i>karamoa</i> form of <i>taramoa</i> `lawyer' parallel with<i> karamea / taramea</i> `spear grass'. If it denotes <i>tumatakuru,</i> it perhaps represents an idiosyncratic hearing of the final- <i>kuru. </i>

There generally grows near these a plant called the timuka, from the leaf of which the natives make mats and leggings, which are impervious to the sharp points of the former.

Quote:  A rare example of real ... wit in the criminal class is `Kathleen Mavourneen' or `kath' for an indeterminate sentence. This dates from about 1910 and originated either in New Zealand or in Australia. i remember well the delight with which it was told to me by the late Mr Justice O.T.J. Alpers who had come upon it in the course of his practice as a barrister. This was about 1910. Another fancy term for this tantalising sentence, `Cat and Mouse', is also clever and witty but less poetical.

Quote:  Not that she cared about appearances. She earned extra money when she could and in her third year had a `Kathleen Mavourneen' loan arranged through the registrar. `Kathleen Mavourneen'? The tag had currency [ca 1933 at Auckland University College] from an irish song popular at community sings, with the punch line `it may be for years and it may be for ever.' Such a loan was interest-free, but Kath wasn't the sort to leave it for ever. She paid it back three years after graduating. it must have come from a private source - another of Rocke O'Shea's little dodges for keeping students keeping on.

Quote:  Early Maori who named the spider 'night stinger' were loath to sleep in dunes at night and even now, tales of the dreaded katipo arouse anxiety amongst driftwood collectors or those contemplating a frolic in the dunes... There are two recognised species of katipo; <i>Latrodectus katipo</i> and <i>L. atritus</i>. Both are peculiar to New Zealand and can be distinguished by the coloration [sic] of adult females. Adult female <i>L. katipo</i> are primarily velvet black with the exception of a bright red dorsal stripe and a distinctive red, hourglass-shaped marking on the underside of the abdomen... in contrast, adult female <i>L. atritus</i> although almost identical in colouration and size, lack the dorsal stripe, and the red hourglass on the underside of their abdomen is less distinct.

This is the oil which figures on northern maps extraordinarily, for instance, the L&S (1943) Provisional sheet N27 at map ref 601521, `Old Oil Well'. ... This oil was (can i say?) a seep of sap (pre-solid kauri gum?) from buried kauri; as far as i know it was used in mixing paint.

Quote:  ``Kauri Silk', generally in the form of plaited strands representing the long tresses of blonde hair often seen on young girls of the period, appeared during this time. ...

`When a plait was made, often up to five feet long in finished form, it was tied with a ribbon and bow, top and bottom, and coiled in a suitable box, and offered for sale, or entered in any suitable exhibition competitions. ... To produce a nice specimen it is essential to have a good piece of gum. it would require to weigh about two pounds, [26] so that it could be firmly gripped, and should be pale and clear, and free from ruptures and defects. This seems to be difficult to acquire in these days. The lump must be scraped and cleaned and dried. ...

`With an old metal frypan or an old metal plate on the hot range, moved about to get just the right temperature, the lump of gum was pressed on to the plate until the surface melted, and was then slowly drawn out to arm's length or further, and as this was done, the melted surface miraculously came away in these beautiful drawn fibres, which were placed on the nearby table. The operation was completed [sic: ? repeated] until the required three bundles of strands were produced. These were plaited with a standard three-plait. The conditions of the old-time warm and humid kitchen were very necessary for the success of this process, as the gum fibres when cold are very fragile.

Quote:  Away in the western distance rose the foothills of the Southern Alps where the ti (cabbage) trees grew in abundance. The carrot-shaped roots and the young stems of the cabbage tree were the [29] source of the delicacy known as kauru ... The kauru was gathered just before the trees flowered, when the plants were at their sweetest. Roots and stems were steamed in large ovens to crystallise their sugar content. The cooked kauru was then pulled apart, dipped in the water and chewed.

Quote:  The banks by the track are massed with kawakawa, Macropiper excelsa, their heart-shaped leaves reduced to green "lace": by resident caterpillars .. "Kawakawa contains toxins in its leaves .. When it's chewed or browsed that increases the amount of toxins it produces. The caterpillar comes along - there's only one species of caterpillar that can feed on kawakawa - it chews a hole, gets a bellyache, falls off on a little strand of silk."

Rangatiratanga</i> is subject to an acknowledgment of <i>Kawanatanga</i>. The working out in practice of the balance between the two Articles must depend upon a case by case consideration. ... it is the <i>right</i> of all citizens, Maori, Pakeha, and other New Zealanders, that there be effective Government or <i>Kawanatanga</i> in such matters.

One person would call a boy's name out of the whole group and try to catch him and pat three times on his back before he got to the other end. if caught he would form part of the catching team. if not caught the whole school would go to the other end - any caught would form part of the catching team. The game would end with almost the whole school forming the catchers and trying to catch a rampaging All Black type. At times a rather rough game.

The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. in such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter.

Quote:  it is unfortunate that the Butterfish [<i>Coridodax pullus</i> ] has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish but it should be remembered that in the North island the Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>), a very different fish, is related to the Butterfish [?though] there is superficially little resemblance between the two species. <i>ibid.</i> 169 Kelpi Coridodax pullus Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish

Quote:  Outside of a university professor or two, not many New Zealanders can say they have created a new breed of sheep but Roger Marshall can. The Rangitikei farmer's Kelso breed is firmly established as a producer of meaty, high-performance sheep. The Kelsos are a composite of Finn and Texel on a Coopworth-Romney base, with a dash of East Friesian. Starting by mating Finns to his Coopworth-Romneys, and then adding Texels and a small number of East Friesians, it took him five years to develop the Kelso. in all, 11000 Kelso ewes are spread across six farms.

Quote:  Chamber sets had to be well anchored in the country and heavy bearers inserted beneath them to carry the `keps' or chairs on which the cages were placed when winding trucks of ore from the level. The legs supporting the first set above the level would be about ten feet high. <i>ibid. </i>316 <i>`Clips", "keps", or landing chairs</i>: A solid, dead flush, landing platform for the cages was required at each level and at the surface for getting full trucks in and out of cages. This platform was provided by a steel frame mounted on heavy bearers two or three feet below the level of the chamber floor so that it could be tilted into the shaft by a lever and make a strong support beneath the cages. it was balanced by a counterweight to make it easy to operate.

Quote:  To ensure that the two cages in the shaft worked exactly opposite each other when the chamberman `changed gear' to wind ore from a different level, he rang the change signal of five bells on the steel-wire knocker-line suspended in the shaft compartment, and the engine-driver placed the `free' cage on the surface `clips' (or `keps") and disengaged it on the engine drive-shaft. The chamberman then signalled to lift the `fast' cage on the level where he was working just clear of the clips, and pinned these back clear of the shaft. He entered the `fast' cage and rang the number of the level to which he wished to change, and was taken there by the driver. On arrival at the level he placed the clips in position in the shaft and rang the change signal, whereupon the driver placed the `fast' cage on the clips and put the `free' cage (which was sitting on the surface clips) in gear on the engine drive-shaft. Thus, when the cage was raised from the level to the surface, the cage from the surface would be exactly at the level from which the winding was taking place. Great care had always to be taken to ensure that the clips were not left protruding into the shaft as a serious accident could result if the cage crashed into them.

kerosene tin
Homonym Number:
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:R.Mason notes `This might deserve mention if only to compare with the early stages of the billy. Any 4-gallon tin of the standard size and shape [ ] is called a `kerosene tin', even if it had held benzine (as often in the twenties before the days of bowsers), oil or meths. A standard utensil'. Kerosene tins were put to innumerable domestic, farming, trade and private uses, as buckets, utensils, containers, or (flattened out) building material up to the 1939-45 War, since when they have been gradually replaced by other containers etc. (in some pronunciations almost a special compound [kero / si:ntin], as its frequent hyphenation would indicate.)

To save time ... you do not waste time by chopping down each tree individually, but just `scarf' and partly chop each tree. When all is ready and you have worked back to the key, you scarf it very carefully. ... if everything goes according to plan it will `drive' the one below, which will in turn drive the next, and so on ...

Quote:  <i>Kia ora, interj.</i> Maori phrase used by English in the North island of New Zealand, and meaning `Health to you!'. A private letter (1896) say - `You will hear any day at a Melbourne bar the first man say <i>Keora ta-u</i>, while the other says <i>Keora tatu,</i> so replacing `Here's to you!'. These expressions are corruptions of the Maori, <i>Kai ora taua</i>,' `Health to us too!' and <i>Kia ora tatou</i>,' Health to all of us!'
Notes:  [Morris is in part wrong:<i> taua</i> is the dual pronoun `we two, us two' (not `us too"); <i>tatou</i> is the plural personal pronoun `you all, and myself; all of us (inclusive)!]

When asked by me for his hesitancy and discrimination in regard to several apparently prime blacks, his answer was that they `killed' badly. So many statements, nevertheless, continue to be accepted because it is nobody's interest to disprove them, that this dealer's belief is given for what it was worth. On the other hand, what Sandy Grant did not know of sheep was not worth knowing.

Despite kina being prolific breeders and voracious, aggressive eaters (they compete for broken kelp with paua and end up eating the paua out of house and home), our national kina resource, however large, is fragile.

Quote:  There are those who nostalgically look back on the days of no-licence and sly grog and wonder where the move to have the King Country union discard the traditional `King Country spanner' as its emblem originated. For the uninitiated, the King Country spanner was more than just a bottle-opener - it was a symbol of stout-hearted refusal to submit meekly to a `dry' regime that King Country thought was unjustly imposed on it. You could always get `it' if you knew how.

Quote:  in Tom's early years at Puketiti, anything up to forty axemen were employed. They usually worked in gangs of four, and a gang would sometimes scarf for a full week before they let the `King' tree go. The procedure was to work `drives'. Depending on various factors, a certain defined area would be `scarfed', i.e. each tree in that area would have a scarf cut in it to the point where it was about to fall, and when the whole of that particular area was completed the `King' tree would be felled. This tree, specially selected for the purpose, would be so situated that, as it fell, it would take two or three of the scarfed trees with it. They in turn would do the same, and so on, and the whole area would fall almost as one. This is known as working a drive, and saves a tremendous amount of axe work.

Tenison Woods says the King-fish of Port Jackson must not be confounded with the King-fish of Victoria or the King-fish of Tasmania (<i>Thyrsites micropus</i>, McCoy). The Port Jackson king-fish belongs to a genus called `Yellow-tails' in Europe. This is <i>Seriola lalandii</i>, Cuv. and Val. <i>Seriola</i> belongs to the family <i>Carangidae</i>, or Horse-Mackerels.<i>Thyrsites</i> belongs to the family <i>Trichiuridae</i>. The `Barracouta' of Australasia is another species of <i>Thyrsites,</i> and the `Frost-fish' belongs to the same family. The <i>King-fish</i> of America is a different fish; the name is also applied to other fishes in Europe.

Quote:  There is much confusion in the common names applied to New Zealand fishes, and the application of the name `Hake' to several distinct species of our fishes, is a good example of that confusion. in Blenheim, Nelson, Picton and Wellington, a very different fish, scientifically known as <i>Rexea solandri</i>, and closely related to the Barracouta, with obviously no affinities to the Cod family, is called `Hake' or `Southern Kingfish'. The name Hake applied to this fish is entirely wrong, as it belongs to the Snake Mackerel family, the <i>Gempylidae</i>. The other name, `Southern Kingfish', is more appropriate, although it suggests affinities with another family of fishes, which are associated in New Zealand with the name of `Kingfish', namely the Carangidae or Trevally (occasionally spelt Trevalli) family, which includes the `Yellowtail' or `Kingfish' (<i>Regificola grandis</i>).

Their reigning potentate was Tawhiao, son of their first king, old Potatau, who died a short time before this period. The idea of having a king, or the king movement, was started by Wiremu Thompson, one of the leading Waikato chiefs, who was afterwards called `the King-maker'. <i>ibid.</i> 9 The Kingites, as the Waikatos styled themselves, were so called on account of their having set up for themselves a king.

Quote:  But the most interesting of all the team games was a small group game variously known as <i>Cunning Joe</i> (K-6), Cunny, Conjure, Conjo, Cunny Joe, and Cronje. in this game the cat [a thin 6-inch stick with pointed ends] was sometimes called the Cunning Joe stick (Waikouaiti, Otago, 1900) or the kip (Dunedin, 1895). it was a game for four players.

Two rings were marked on the ground a short distance from each other with a square drawn in the middle of each. A boy armed with a short stick stood at each ring, a bowler behind him. One of the bowlers tossed a short piece of wood at the ring opposite. The striker hit it as hard as he could, then both boys ran as in cricket.

After 1940 the kiwi became synonymous with New Zealand servicemen overseas. The Kiwi Concert Party, which toured many battle areas during the Second World War, and the Kiwi (New Zealand Army) Football Team, which toured the British isles, France, and Germany in 1945-46, greatly enhanced the emblem's popularity. ...

But the commonest feeling is one of intense identification. We <i>are</i> Kiwis - rare and special ground-dwelling creatures.

Quote:   in every New Zealand poet, almost, there is a streak of the `Kiwi' - our word for patriotic common man - who disapproves, distrusts, or despises the personal voice. And the `Kiwi', though the term is of recent adoption, and for all his insecurity and raucousness, is a bird of some social ancestry. Our Victorian founders, by the mere act of turning colonist, made irrevocable divorce out of their century's separation of the poetic and the practical.

Notes:WW2 usage is rare in this sense and seems applied as a descriptive term by outsiders rather than used by NZ troops themselves: early in WW2 used as distinct from Digger (rather appropriated by Australians) and WW1 Anzac. Possibly first applied by non-New Zealand units, and adopted as appropriate, as a noun, as an attributive and (occas.) as a term of address. Often humorously pronounced [kaiwai], perhaps in imitative guying of American pronunciations.

And for the name, you can be forgiven if you call our imported possum (the `brushtail possum,' to be precise) an opossum. The Aussie possum - there are about six types across the Tasman - looked so much like the American counterpart when first discovered by Europeans that it was called an opossum. As recently as 1981, scientists who turned up for the first New Zealand symposium on marsupials ... were sagely talking about possums in 12 of the papers presented while their colleagues talked about opossums in six papers. All were referring to the same nocturnal nuisance. One of the great achievements of that symposium was to finish up talking the same language after taking a vote that favoured for possum. ... The fur trade is pushing for `NZ phalanger' (a generic name for a group of marsupials) while possum stew exporters are trying to win acceptance for `Kiwi bear' in Oriental restaurants.

Quote:  Hard on the heels of the Black Ferns have come the Kiwi Ferns, their counterparts in rugby league, the men's international team having long been referred to as the Kiwis. (The New Zealand women were pitted against the touring Lionesses from Great Britain in recent test matches.)    These two rugby coinages will greatly strengthen an association between ferns and New Zealand sportswomen, though the inevitable abbreviation Ferns (the union men having already appropriated Blacks) will now be ambiguous out of context. Singular forms Black Fern and Kiwi Fern are now predictable, with the stress likely to settle on the first element rather than, as in Silver Fern, on the second (compare Black Caps and others below).

But he says kiwiana doesn't encompass the "complexity and the kind of gnarliness" of our culture. it's not popular culture. it's minority culture, and a very small minority culture."... As for Wedde's own kiwiana possessions - any paua shell collections, punga vases? "i guess it would be my gas barbecue, or Skilsaw. They're associated with a very Kiwi way of life and have a quality that's, sort of, very familiar."

This responsibility has been that of Terry Vaughan, the Kiwis Producer and Musical Director. However, it is no new task to him, having been with the Kiwis ever since their inception in the Middle East in 1941 when the 2nd N.Z.E.F. formed its own Entertainment Unit with men of the Division. Sir Bernard Freyberg, V.C., now His Excellency the Governor General of New Zealand, has always kept a paternal eye on his `Kiwi Concert Party'.

Quote:  One common prank was Knick Knock. in this game, children knocked on someone's door, then ran away, but it could be played more elaborately: in Tick Tack we stuck a pin into the middle sash of a window; a button was suspended from this on a piece of cotton. Then a long length of cotton was attached to the smaller piece and led away to the gate. The cotton was pulled every now and then and the button tapped against the window. it was nighttime, and folks would pull up the blind and peer out. Some more adventurous spirits would come out and investigate and would maybe get entangled with the cotton. Then the culprit would run away to some other house. (1900; Moeraki)

Quote:  <i>Stagknife</i> (K-31), a universal game of nineteenth-century childhood, was important because it was played with the most treasured play object of all boys, the pocket knife. Although known in nearly all parts of New Zealand by the name of Stagknife, the game was also known as Bites, Jackknife, Stabknife, Knifey, Momley Peg, and Throwing the Knife. ... There were generally two players ... who each sought to deflect the point of the pocket knife from certain parts of the body by a flick of the hand in such a way that the blade would stick firmly into the ground. ... Every movement had to be done three times. [172] Typical movements were: (1) Place the open pocket knife (loose) [name of movement] [sic] on the closed knuckles of the right hand, point the knife towards the thumb, then with a quick upward flick of the hand to the left, deflect the point of the knife into the ground.

Quote:  in the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (in more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

Quote:  The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

The term `Knuckle down Stiff' (Taranaki [18]80, Gisborne [18]85, Waitara [18]95) is mentioned by [Lady A.B. Gomme Vo. 1, p.113]. ... As Taranaki [18]80 says, `The term was called out in order to prevent too easy a success against a marble near the ring'. it was less advantageous to fire with the hand on the ground than with the hand elevated, perhaps at `Knee High'.

Quote:  Many heated arguments arose as to who said `everythings' or `nothings' first. if a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime.

Koha is a traditional part of the powhiri, where the manuhiri are invited to a marae, and lay down their gifts for the tangata whenua. The koha is laid down by the last speaker of the manuhiri, it signifies that there are no more speakers and the manuhiri have finished.

Koheriki is a little plant 1ft to 2 ft in height that is very suitable on rock-work in the open.

The Kohoperoa, one of these cuckoos, is about the size and colour of the sparrow-hawk; the Pipiwarauroa cuckoo is a much smaller and a more variegated-feathered bird.

Quote:  Koukoupara - is a fish like the kokopu, but differently marked, and following the example of one of his informants, the translator [sc Beattie] has translated this as `mountain trout'. Koukoupara is the spelling adopted in the lists, but the [Maori] compilers have varied this with kopara, koupara, and kokaupara. Never once do they use the southern form of kokopara, which the southerners pronounced kokobala, which the early settlers soon turned into `cockabully'.

[59] Before the coming of motorised transport, the mode of transportation was the `Chatham island Truck' (Konake), a wooden flat-decked horse or bullock-drawn vehicle, with iron or wooden wheels at the back and sledge runners on the front. Also in use was the `jogger' a cartlike vehicle with two pneumatic-tyred wheels, seating about three people and drawn by two horses attached to a shaft. They worked on the principle of the African Cape Cart. The pole (shaft) was attached to the collars of the horses. Tom McClurg of Te Whakuru made the first `jogger' in Chathams, about 1940.

The same term is applied in the North island equally to the whole plant, and to the dried flower-stem when cut for rafts or other purposes; or exclusively to the flower-stalk. in the North [83] island, the Flax-plant is also known as `Harakeke,' or `Herekiakia,' - its usual name there. ... The lower part of the flower-stem is `Kaikaha;' the outer part of the leaf `Parakoka;' [a1, o-macron] the refuse of the leaf `Hunga-hunga;' the flax, dressed or not, or scraped fibre, manufactured from the leaf, `Whitau,' or `Muka.'

There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

Koukoupara is the spelling adopted in the lists, but the [Maori] compilers have varied this with kopara, koupara, and kokaupara. Never once do they use the southern form of kokopara, which the southerners pronounced kokobala, which the early settlers soon turned into `cockabully'.

Quote:  The tide was ebbing, and had left the beach red with `kouraraki,' a small crustaceous animal not unlike the shrimp, but more diminutive. They were still alive, and so numerous that they formed a stratum three or four inches thick, to walk over which was as if one trod on new-fallen snow. The `kouraraki' are fed on by the whale; and their appearance early, and in abundance, was hailed as the prognostic of a good season.

Quote:  (W.J. Elvy `Maori History') Much has been writted concerning the so-called pit [387] dwellers, who formerly inhabited the district. When Europeans commenced to settle in the Sounds the bush had practically established itself to the water's edge. The few vestiges of aboriginal cultivation were rapidly becoming clothed with a dense second growth and, except for a few localities occupied by the remnants of native tribes, had been practically obliterated. As the colonists commenced to clear the bush, despite the fact that on their land were large forest trees that had apparently taken centuries to grow, vestiges of an ancient occupation were brought to light in the shapes square or oblong pits. These pits were of varying shapes and sizes, many bunched into steep spurs and forming a series that reached from the shores to the tops of the low hills, and all placed in secure positions on land not liable to slip. These numerous pits were widely scattered throughout the Sounds and, some being similar to those in use in the North as store pits, they were called by the settlers' `Kumera pits' under the impression that they had been used to store those tubers for food supply. investigation proved this idea to be erroneous; the pits were found in positions unsuitable for such storage and the presence of shell heaps amongst them proved that they had formed part of the dwellings of an ancient people.

Quote:  <i>ku[u]mara</i> is the spelling of the name of this tuber, and this has been

the spelling in the <i>Journal of the Polynesian Society</i>, for instance, from its first volume in 1892 to the present day. it has more than one been suggested that the tuber first came from Peru, and this is fully discussed in <i>Journal of the Polynesian Society</i>, vol. 54 (1945), 175, where the point is made that the northern Quichua-speaking people of Peru and Ecuador have the sweet potato and know it under the names kumar, komal, and kumal, which names have as counteraprts in Polynesia the terms kumara in Newzealand (Maori), Rarotonga, the Tuamotus, Mangareva, and Easter island; umara and umaa in Tahiti; kumala in Tonga, 'umala in Samoa; uala and uwala in Hawaii; with kumaa in the Marqueses; and ku'a'ra in Mangaia. Remembering the "l" and :r: interchange in some of the dialects, and remembering the dropping of letters as indicated by hamzah, it seems evident that the form kumara represents all these different forms: seeing, too, that in none of them is the median "a" replaced by "e," there seems to be no doubt that the correct spelling is kumara and not kumera. in Williams' <i>Dictionary</i>, ku[u]mara is the main entry: there is an entry kumera, but is no more than a reference; ku[u]mera = kumara.

Notes: Jim Cameron writes: The entries in DNZE and NZPOD need modification and updating. Doubtless originally feral, the kunekune is a registered breed of domestic pig, much favoured by lifestylers. See article Pigs Might Fly, <i>Growing Today</i>, Feb. 1995, 49 and ad in same magazine May 1995 - "Kunekune boar registered pedigree."

Quote:  if animals had their pop. charts, New Zealand's kune kune pig would have to find a high place among the list of unusual animals. Even those most closely attached to the kune kune shake their heads over them. it's surprising, therefore, that such a rare character should be so little known and so little appreciated - and that so few are aware of how close kune kune pigs are to becoming extinct. TESSA WARD continues her series of articles.

Quote:  New Zealand has never had a native pig. The <i>Dominion</i> newspaper, National Radio's <i>Rural Report</i>, and the 12.30 National News are all in the process of perpetrating a myth. Each of their news items told of a `rare native pig - the kunekune'. Dr Clive Dalton, of Ruakura Animal Research Station, said that only about 80 of these small round pigs remain; ... No trace of pig of any species has been excavated from archaic sites in this country.... The kunekune pigs are likely to have been brought to New Zealand by the Chinese coming to the goldmines of central Otago and for that reason as a special breed are well worthy of preservation.

Quote:  it wasn't always like this, though - why, when i think back to the times we rode many miles over the hills to gather kai moana to supplement our everyday diet. There were paua, kutai, and kaura, big and red, when they were in season. This entailed a whole day's journey, and more often than not we stayed half the night also, netting for fish at the narrows of the bay. We would return home with our pihau bags laden heavy with shellfish and fish. The fish, mostly mullet, were sorted, cleaned, gutted and then smoked. Fat plumpy kutai were shelled and bottled.
