Quote: There was [postal] work [in the 1960s], hard satisfying work. Unloading parcel bags, huge cumbersome containers nicknamed pre-fabs, from a three-door Z. There was slots, there was lumps, there was packing fragies in bottlos, there was the tying down of the north line for a clearance, the scissors, lead seals and squeezers. The sorters on call-back flicking circulars with precision. The volcanoes of letters on the facing-up table, the checker chanting the reds onto the lorry, the checker calling the overseas in, London 45 ... The queue of men working at the parcel depot or the postal siding ... Tieing down the cargon. ... The sorters' school at the posties' pub known colloquially as Box 44 or the B.B.C., the Back Bar of the Cecil. The cheerful abuse of cobbers

Quote: Next to the X class. is the Z class, orwhat are often referred to as theCornwall Cup boats. They owe theirexistence to a small band of Takapunayachtsmen who planned the first boat,with much the same idea in their minds asdid George Honour when he built the firstof the 14-foot square bilge boats,namely, low first cost, ease ofconstruction, and an ever-watchful eye onspeed and performance under Aucklandharbour weather conditions.  The yachtswere originally designed for the TakapunaBoating Club but owing to theirpopularity from the outset the type wasquickly adopted by many other yacht clubsthroughout New Zealand... From smallbeginnings the Takapuna one-design  classrapidly expanded.

A colonial robert  is obviously a play on the English slang bob for a shilling. (Colonial robert was in use in New Zealand before the turn of the century, and was also recorded about the time of the first World War.) (Otago Witness 24 Jan. 1912:32) Along with the Australians, New  Zealanders used zweideener for the florin (zwei meaning two),  and zack for sixpence.

Quote: Zamzoid. This word was noted - believe it or not - in what has come to be regarded as something of a New Zealand classic, Robin Hyde's  The Godwits Fly. ... Thereafter it was easy. My English Dialect Dictionary swiftly produced an adjective sam meaning `half-heated' (of food) and an adjective sammy meaning `Soft, clammy, sticky'. I was clearly on the right track for those imperfectly washed forks. A further scan produced (in various phonetic spellings samsawed, samsawdered, samzawed,  sam-zawey) a clutch of examples of past-participle/adjectival forms all with the sense of `lukewarm' - used of food that has been cooked and then laid aside until it has begun to coagulate into a sticky mess.

The Chambers informant writes:`There seems to be/have been some doubt about the existence of the New Zealand subregion in any case. It appears in the article on `Distribution of Animals' in the New World Encyclopedia (New York, 1903), but not in the Encyclopedia Britannica (1910-11). Of a non-geographical use of the word, implied by Webster's and Chambers, I can find no trace.

Essentially, it's a giant double-skinned plastic ball in which thrill-seeking punters at <i>Zorb Rotorua</i> are secured by harnesses and sent rolling over and over 170 metres downhill. Then there's the wet Zorb experience - akin to tossing yourself into a frontloader washing machine on gentle cycle. A bucket of water is sloshed in, the entrance is plugged and, as the Zorb rolls, the challenge is to stay standing by running, damply, on the spot.

Quote: <i> Zosterops </i> ... the scientific name of a genus of Australian birds, often called also popularly by that name, and by the names of  <i> Wax-eye, White-eye, Silver-eye ... Ring-eye, Blight-bird </i> ... From the Greek, . . . a girdle, `anything that goes round like a girdle'; the birds of the genus have a white circle round their eyes. The bird was not generally known in New Zealand until after  <i> Black Thursday </i>	 (q.v.), in 1851, when it flew to the Chatham Islands. Some observers, however, noted small numbers of one species in Milford Sound in 1832. New Zealand birds are rarely gregarious, but the <i> Zosterops </i> made a great migration, in large flocks, from the South Island to the North Island in 1856, and the Maori name for the bird is `The Stranger'  <i> Tau-hou </i>). Nevertheless, Buller thinks that the species  (<i> Z. caerulescens </i> is indigenous in New Zealand. (See under <i> Silver-eye </i>, quotation 1888.)

Quote: Our nearness to Australia also resulted in our adoption of slang words in use there. Examples of these include goldie for  sovereign, and little goldie for a half sovereign.  A colonial robert is obviously a play on the English slang bob for a shilling. (Colonial robert was in use in New Zealand before the turn of the century, and was also recorded about the time of the first World War.)
