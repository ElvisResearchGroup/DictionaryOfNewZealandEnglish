Quote: The 1948 Land Act, which introduced 33-year pastoral leases, encouraged farmers to invest in their land. The subsequent advent of aerial topdressing - which allowed fertilising and the spreading of rabbit baits over sizeable areas - slowed degradation dramatically, as did improvements in fencing technology, the introduction of the poison 1080 and increased research into pastoral management.

Quote: [The Maori implement's] genuineness has been questioned, one sceptic asserting that is was neither more nor less than a British marlinspike; but the carving was of native pattern, and the pointed portion, instead of being conical as is common in European, was also characteristically Maori in type ... The late Archdeacon Williams had told him it was called an ahao, and he found that another name was purupuru. Only recently, through the assistance of Mr. Percy Smith and the knowledge of some old-time Maoris at New Plymouth, had he found its purpose. It was really a marlinspike used for the caulking of sea-going canoes, and having a like end in view, the Maori had developed an implement almost exactly resembling that of the Europeans.

Quote: A number of readers have alerted me to an error in my recent column about Little Akaloa... I quoted Lona Waghorn's book about the history of this settlement, in which she stated that there is no L in the Maori alphabet...[They] all point out... that the letter L is very common in the southern Maori dialect (in particular, the Southland Murihuku variation), and Waghorn's book must have been published before about 1980, when the dialect was largely ignored and the acceptable standard was that spoken by Waikato Maori. Other place names, such as Lake Waihola in South Otago and the nearby settlement of Wangaloa, also show this dialectical variation. Still others have been helpfully changed to sound more "Maori", such as Rangiora and Kaikoura, which were recorded by one Captain Edwardson in 1823 as Rockiola and Kowkoula, because that was the way the southern tribes pronounced them.

Although the natives still refuse to alienate the lands on the Upper Thames for mining uses, yet from the fact that parties of them have received from the Provincial Government recently large sums for gold licenses on the lower river, it may be supposed that their patriotism or obstinacy will yield in time to the temptation of increasing their easily-acquired gains.

Quote: A Printer's Error? The name All Blacks is given to members of Rugby Union Football teams which represent New Zealand. It came into vogue during the 1905 tour of the British Isles by the `Original' All Blacks, as that team is now called. According to the statement (July 1964) ofW.J. Wallace (q.v.), one of the four surviving members of the 1905 team, the title was the result of a printer's error. It appears that R.J. Seddon (q.v.),  then Premier of New Zealand, had arranged with the Daily Mail (London) to cover the tour, with the result that a reporter, Buttery, travelled everywhere with the team. After the match against the Hartlepool Clubs on 11 October 1905, at West Hartlepool, which New Zealand won 63-0, Buttery reported that the whole team, backs and forwards alike, had played with speed and precision as if they were `all backs'. This comment was repeated after the Northumberland game on 14 October (31-0) and the Gloucester City Club match on 19 October (44-0). But when the New Zealand team arrived at Taunton to play Somerset County (21 October), they found the whole town placarded with posters welcoming the `All Blacks'. Buttery inquired into the matter and reported to the team's management committee that the printer had in error inserted and `l' in `Backs'. The name appealed and henceforth the players were known as All Blacks. -->Early Uniforms Printer's error aside, one may assume that the 1905 team which wore `all black' uniform - only recently adopted - would sooner or later receive such a name. The 1884 New Zealand team to tour Australia, and the first to go overseas, had for its uniform a dark blue jersey with a gold fernleaf over the left breast, dark knickerbockers, and stockings. It was certainly not `All Black'. In April 1893, however, when the New Zealand Rugby Union was established, it was resolved that the New Zealand representative colours should be `... Black Jersey with Silver Fernleaf, Black Cap with Silver Monogram, White Knickerbockers and Black Stockings.'  This was the standard uniform for some years, though photographs of the 1894 and 1896 teams show that white shorts, and not knickerbockers, were worn. There is no photograph of the 1897 team in uniform - in the official photograph they are shown wearing long trousers - but in the New Zealand Graphic of 14 August 1897 there is a cartoon of a New Zealand footballer wearing a black jersey and white shorts. -->The `All Black' Uniform At some point between 1897 and 1901 there was a vital change, concerning which the records of the New Zealand Rugby Union are silent. But by 1901 the New Zealand team to meet New South Wales wore a black jersey (canvas top, no collar), silver fern (now neater and smaller), and black shorts and stockings. The `All Blacks' had arrived in fact, if not in name. -->The 1905 Tour When the 1905 tour of Britain began on 16 September the players were referred to as the New Zealand Football Team or, more simply, the New Zealanders, though occasionally terms such as `Maorilanders' and `Colonials' did service. When, however, the Hartlepool game of 11  October was reported in the Daily Mail by Buttery, there appears for the first time a reference to `All Black Play' and its complement, `All Black Cameraderie'. From then on the new name gradually won acceptance, so much so that by early November, following the match with Surrey (1 November), the Daily Mail made direct mention of the All Black team `that everybody is talking about'. It is also interesting to note that on 15 November 1905 the term `Blacks' had even appeared in the pages of Punch which printed a number of stanzas dealing with the shortcomings of Seddon, the last running as follows:  Can it be your head is turned/  By your team of Rugby `Blacks'?/  Has the glory they have earned/  Set you trotting in their tracks?/  Well, it's not mere weight and gristle,/  You must also play the game,/  Or the referee may whistle/  And you'll have yourself to blame/  If you get a free kick where you don't expect the same./  Although the new name `caught on' so quickly in Britain, its acceptance in New Zealand was much slower. Seddon, for instance, with that political opportunism which both irritated and amused his opponents, followed up each victory with congratulatory cablegrams addressed to `the colony's football team' (mid-October) or `the New Zealand football team' (4 December). The newspapers were equally tardy in adopting the term but by 21 November the New Zealand Herald referred to the `Triumphal March of the Blacks'. A few weeks later (6 December) it headed a column `"All Black' Gossip"; editorially, however, it always used the more formal term, `New Zealand Footballers'.  Thus on 5 March 1906, the day of the team's arrival at Auckland, the Herald editorially acclaimed the `New Zealand Footballers', but on the following day it headed its report of the official function of welcome with a bold double-column caption - `Return of the All Blacks'. Meanwhile, throughout the country special shop window displays and feature advertisements `to mark the return of the All Blacks' suddenly appeared. The `All Blacks' had indeed arrived.

The All Blacks had worn black jerseys since 1893 and the manager of the Originals, George Dixon, kept a copious diary on the tour (which has never been published but one day should be). In it, from the time the team left Wellington, he refers constantly to the team as "the All Blacks".

Quote: The name All Blacks was given to the first national rugby representatives to tour Britain, France and Canada, in 1905-06 (subsequently termed the originals, or Original All Blacks). Though no word could now be more Kiwi. it was in Fact coined by a Brit and used in British newspapers before being adopted back home (the players were named for their strip, and an alternative explanation involving inadvertent alteration of the phrase 'all backs' is flawed; see DNZE s.v. all black).

Quote: Occasionally unusual types of hiding games were played, for example All In or Taranaki. In this game there were two teams and a home base. One team, the `outs,' went and hid, while the home team, looked for the `outs.' As soon as an `in' player saw an `out,' he cried, `All in for Tommy Jones' (the `out' player who had been spotted). At that cry all the `in' players raced for home, and all the `out' players emerged from their hiding places and attempted to tag them. If all the `in' players could get home without being tagged, then the person seen (Tommy Jones), was considered captured, and he had to come and sit in the home base, And so the `in' team wenton trying to sight players and [53] then get home without being tagged.

Notes: a). In 1981 and at the World Cup in 1982 the All Whites wore a white uniform with three black strips along the shoulder and black edging so I'd be careful of any mention of removing the black strip. b). The booklet "by Gray and Becht" has the words "All White" in the title only. It was also "edited by Paul Elenio". It has no precise date but could have preceded the first newspaper reference. c). Nat. Lib. does not have Sunday Star or Christchurch Star for May 1892. d). The first Dominion ref. (13 May) is an article by Gray. The second ref (20 May) is a Press Association message. e). My betting is that Gray did originate the term; would be worth ringing him at the Dom to confirm. I could not find it any earlier than 13 May - before that and elsewhere after that references are to Kiwis or the New Zealand team.

Quote: Apart from the rather curious term double All Black, recorded in DNZE from the 1960s and meaning a man who has represented New Zealand at both rugby union and cricket (even though our cricketers have never been called All Blacks), there were no other secondary formations for another 75 years, when the previously overshadowed soccer code in New Zealand enjoyed its finest hour as the national team against huge odds qualified for the 1982 World Cup in Spain.Since a black strip was especially unsuitable for the warm Asian venues of many of the qualifying games, the team broke with tradition and were kitted out in (virtually) all white, so that the All Whites in name were the All Blacks' opposites, being for a time genuine rivals for the public's attention. However in August last year Soccer New Zealand formally dropped this to date most durable of the names modelled on All Blacks (not without complaints from some of the stalwart players of the 1980s), citing the risk of adverse reaction overseas, that is to what might be perceived as a racially insensitive label. New Zealand has been reinstated as the soccer team's   name,   though   administrators acknowledge that All Whites is likely to remain in more informal and unofficial reference.

Quote: `Although originating probably from a coniferous tree related to the Kauri pine, it nevertheless has been erroneously taken for Kauri gum.'-[Footnote]: `It is sufficiently characterised to deserve a special name; but it comes so near to real amber that it deserves the name of Ambrite.'

Quote: The early Wesleyan and English Church Mission missionaries, who arrived in New Zealand in the early years of the century, found the Ngapuhi tribe of the far north in possession of the red tail feathers of the tropic bird, which were then much prized decorating the heads of chiefs on festive days. The bird is known to the Natives under the name of Amokura.

Quote: Dr Newman says the amokura is really a native of the tropical islands of the Pacific, and is only a visitor to New Zealand, though accounted by some to be a native. It was on account of its rarity that the Maori chiefs of the old days prized the feathers of the amokura, especially as the feathers are tinged with the sacred kura, or red colour.

Ancestral connections: iwi connections to a particular part of the foreshore and seabed may give a guardianship role. Proved connection will give iwi more say in the management of the area.

Quote: A joint currency between Australia and New Zealand... should be called an Anzac: Australia and New Zealand Amalgamated Currency; and then, in the course of time, it would be shortened to "zac", which was old slang for sixpence - but let's hope the current exchange-rate plunge doesn't take us to that depth!

Quote: Discussions are still rampant concerningthe origin, meaning and application ofthe word "Anzac". The Morning Post hassuddenly awoken to the fact that itsorigin was the Turkish word "anzak,"meaning "to jump," which, together withthe fact that there are kangaroos inAustralia and that Australasian soldiersjumped ashore at Anzac, finally provesthat that is the derivation, and thatcode words of initial letters had nothingto do with it.

It had eventually to be officially notified that `Anzac' was restricted to men who had fought at Gallipoli; owing to the loose way people in general used the word often for Australians and New Zealanders who had never been there at all.'].

Quote: A.N.Z.A.C./ WHO SPOKE THE WORD FIRST?[heading] Nobody, except an occasional odd or eccentric person, disputes the fact that the word `Anzac' came from the initial letters of Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. as Mr C.W.Batten explained in No. 1 issue of `Quick March,' but there is an interesting difference ofopinion as to the first use of these initials as a word.Major Waite discusses the matter in a letter to the Editor of `Quick March,' thus: In a Wellington paper I notice that another soldier has claimed to be the originator of `Anzac.' This was an army cook, who, noticing so many stores coming off marked A.N.Z.A.C. said to his mates: `I wonder how many more of these ------ Anzacs are coming ashore here.' His mates took the thing up, and so the word `Anzac' originated. The poor cook is now dead, having been tapped on the head by an army mule. The cook perhaps is lucky to be dead. As a returned soldier he might have been  miserable.  Poor Anzac! This is the fourth story I have seen in print. (1) The late respected, but now deceased cook. (2) A warrant officer in an Australian Signal unit on the Peninsula. (3) In the `Anzac Book,' General Birdwood definitely states that when he took over the command of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in Egypt, he was asked to select a telegraphic code address for his Army Corps, and adopted the word `Anzac.' Later on, after the landing, he  was asked by General Headquarters to suggest a name for the beach, and in reply he christened it `Anzac Cove.' (4) General Ian Hamilton states, in his preface to `Crusading at Anzac,' A.D. 1915, by Signaller Ellis Silas: `As the man who first, seeking to save himself trouble omitted the five full stops and brazenly coined the word Anzac, I am glad to write a line or two in preface to sketches which may help to give currency to that token throughout the realms of glory.'  The four distinguished soldiers mentioned above (`Anzacs every one,' as the pantomime song has it) are in measure right. In this way: when the two divisions were made into an Army Corps, the full title was `Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.' In the army short cuts are always taken. (!!!Editor). Civilians are always mystified by `the D.A.D.O.S.' and `the D.A.Q.M.G.' It is easy to imagine the harassed adjutant of divisional artillery, or an overworked brigade-major writing A.N.Z.A.C. when referring to the Army Corps, and so, the first day after the formation of the Army Corps, busy soldiers in a hundred different places wrote the new word with full stops after each letter. Our landing was known as the Gaba Tepe landing. In the London Gazette away in June, 1915,  the neighbourhood `of Gaba Tepe' was often referred to. The A.N.Z.A.C. was doing its best to hold its bit of country, and everything came addressed ANZAC - the General's letters as well as the cases of the above-mentioned chef.  Someone must have been the first to write, and someone else perhaps the first to enunciate the honoured word, but who they were will never be decided. 1952 Duff Shepherd's Calendar (1961) 26 Apr 75 It is not that Anzac no longer means anything to me or should now, I feel, be forgotten. 1958 Whitcombe's Modern Junior Dictionary (8th edn) 18 ANZAC A name used from 1915 for `Australian and New Zealand Army Corps'. 1959 Sinclair History 302 [Colonial-NZ glossary] Anzac Australia and New Zealand Army Corps. (First World War, 1914-18) 1966 Encyclopedia NZ 1/53 Such is the respect with which the term Anzac is held that an Order in Council was promulgated on 31 August 1916 forbidding the use of the word in connection with any trade or business. 1984 			Pugsley Gallipoli 70 fn ANZAC came into being when the clerks on Birdwood's Headquarters had a rubber stamp `ANZAC' for registering correspondence. This was credited to Sgt K.M. Little, a New Zealander serving on Birdwood's headquarters. After being in common use among the clerks for some time Maj C.M.

Quote: The `landing' or `Anzac Day' was first celebrated in 1916 with a memorial service, and games and sports among the men of the Expeditionary Force. It became a day of increasing sombreness as the years went by: `a day of wreaths, a day without work or play - even the hotel bars and race courses were closed'.  So it was that `Anzac Day' had two meanings to New Zealanders. To the New Zealand public at home it was the legend created by Ashmead Bartlett's despatches, a proclamation to the world that a junior partner in the British Empire had come of age. Anzac Day became the symbol of our willingness to share the burdens of Empire and those that died were our payment for this.  To the soldiers of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, `Anzac Day' or the `Landing Day' was a myth, as 25 April was Australia's Day. They deserved the credit for gaining that foothold, and the New Zealand role came later. It was a legend created by a naval staff officer when he included `New Zealand' and `New Zealanders' wherever appropriate in Ashmead Bartlett's despatches. However, as the war went on and the toll mounted, each `Anzac Day' became the day the nation remembered its war dead.  It became a symbol of something found in war, something akin to a  passage Malone of Chunuk Bair had marked in Ruskin's Crown of  Wild Olive:  `I found, in brief, that all great nations learned their truth of word, and strength of thought, in war: that they were nourished in war, and wasted by peace, taught by war, and deceived by peace; trained by war and betrayed by peace - in a word, that they were born in war and expired in peace'. To the New Zealand soldiers Anzac Day became the touchstone to an identity, a sense of purpose, a growing recognition of themselves as New Zealanders. It is true that it was a day of sadness, of men gone, but there was also joy and comradeship. Comradeship was vital because it made the obscenities endurable. It overlaid the bitterness and suffering. Anzac Day was a day of  shared experiences remembered. A day of competitions and sports, of a beer with mates, and a toast to those they had served with and loved. This was never recognised by the public at home.

Quote: Aotearoa is the Maori name for New Zealand, though it seems at first to have been used for the North Island only. Many meanings have been given for the name but with Maori names the true meaning can often be found only in a mythological story or in historical fiction illustrating either how the name was given or something of the ideas which prompted  it. Aotearoa is made up of either two or three words, Aotea  and roa or Ao tea and roa. Aotea could be the name of one of the canoes of the great migration, the great magellan cloud near the  bright star Canopus in summer, a bird or even a food; ao is a  cloud, dawn, daytime, or world; tea, white or clear,perhaps bright, while roa means long or tall.

The most popular and enduring meaning assigned to is `long white cloud'. (See McLintock  Encyl. N.Z. (1966) I. 53.) Some authorities say that  Aotearoa was first applied to the North Island only.

Quote: `The name Aotearoa was made popular around 1898 with the publication of William Pember Reeves' book The Long White Cloud - Aotearoa,' historian ... Sir Keith Sinclair says. After 1870, most Maori referred to the country as Niu Tirani - a result of Pakeha settlers calling the three islands New Zealand.  Sir Keith said that in all the written Maori he had read from last century the word Aotearoa had been used in only one newspaper.  Te Wanaanga, published in Napier, used Aotearoa in the 1870s.  Sir Keith said Maori often referred to New Zealand byusing `te motu nei' (in this island).  Sir Keith said the literal translation of Aotearoa was `landof the long twilight'.  The name may have come about because the early Polynesians were not used to the long evenings in New Zealand.

Quote: The combination of ethylene and carbon dioxide known as apple gas was a feature of every big apple consignment. Symptoms were lightheadedness, vomiting and unconsciouness - in that order. I understood it had created problems in older ships with brine pipe cooling - particulary first thing in the morning when the heavy gas exuded by thousand of cases of apples had beenaccumulating all night under closed hatches. Nowadays brine pipes had been replaced by forced air cooling system and it was not usually taken very seriously. At night blowers were constantly reactivating the air in the hold, so when hatches were removed for work each morning most of the fumes dispersed harmlessly enough. However, earlier in the day we had all experienced the racing heart-beat and sense of dizzy well being peculiar to apple gas. ...

Three years ago Owen expressed a similar wish, and I have repeatedly tried, but failed. Yet here they still are in the mountain forests, though, doubtless, fast hastening towards extinction. I saw one in its wild state two years ago in the dense woods of the interior; I saw it clearly....Two living specimens were lately taken by the Acheron, steamer, to Sydney, where they died; these were obtained at the Bay of Islands, where also I once got three at one time. Since then I have not been able to obtain another, although I have offered a great price for one. The fact is, the younger natives .<i> do not know how to take them, and the elder ones having but few wants, and those fully supplied, do not care to do so. Further, they can only be captured by night, and the dog must be well trained to be of service.' </i>

Quote: Aroha - `love' is an inadequate translation. Aroha refers to love for one's own family group, but the tendency now is to use it to refer to one's love for all people, i.e, goodwill. It combines the positive qualities of respect, kindness, hospitality, help and the desire to do good for other, without thought or desire for reciprocal action. It is charity of feelings. (I have yet to hear it used  in a sexual sense). Aroha comes from knowing that one's kin shares common ancestors

In his reply the Minister said: `The term is well established and its meaning well known in the community, and therefore it is not thought necessary to make specific change at this juncture.' Commenting on the present use of the term, the president ... said that it was obviously incorrect and that the present `art unions' were really lotteries.

Quote: How did the art union, now replaced by the Government's `Golden Kiwi' lottery, come by its name? Officers of the Internal Affairs Department said today they believed that under the law operating when the art unions began in 1929, raffles or lotteries could only have works of art for prizes. Alluvial gold had apparently qualified as a work of art and for some years the prizes were [pounds]4000 in alluvial gold, which had to be deposited in the Bank of New Zealand and paid for before any tickets could be sold. Cash finally replaced the alluvial gold prizes, but the name `art union' stuck.

Quote: The term `art union' is today used in a wider sense than the sense in which it is employed in the gaming legislation. The art union proper as defined in the Gaming Act exists only to a limited extent in New Zealand, and is confined to a few academies or societies of fine arts.  What has generally become known as the art union is the national lottery. The term `art union' is due to the fact that originally the prizes in the lottery were alluvial gold. These major art unions are now known as the Golden Kiwi lottery. .. In 1961 the Government decided to replace the art unions with the present Golden Kiwi lottery.

The book agent does his own bullying, and wheedling; the art unionist asks you to do it for him on a 20 percent commission. . . Accompanying this letter. . is a printed circular setting forth the merits of the engravings. "It is certain," says the lottery man, "that many a mind will warm with enthusiasm on becoming possessed of such admirable works of art, which are now placed within the reach of a discerning public at the trifling risk of one shilling."

Quote: They then went furiously to the 4th point - that we were all hirelings and worked for money like the Assessors. One fellow said, `Don't you get your quarter?' I replied, `Certainly! I do not live by stealing.' `Quarter' has, of late years, become a proverbial term; the Government Native Assessors, being paid once a quarter, talk commonly of getting their quarters. The Kingites despise these Maoris who have been bribed over, and hate and deride the `quarter' as conclusive of all that is bad. Hanauru, the King's great priest, who was present, pointed out how he could go about anywhere, all the year round, and wanted  no quarter.

Quote: The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as `government rags', were given various nicknames such as assignats, `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past. Assignats was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters'--sometimes written `skinplasters'--had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.

Quote: ... it is worthy of notice, that the colonists, soon after the formation of all the settlements, acquired distinguishing epithets; thus there was an Auckland cove, a Wellington swell, A Nelson snob, a Taranaki exquisite, an Otago cockney, and a Canterbury pilgrim. These epithets, almost already forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; andthe origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation.

It hunts by night for insects but also likes to sunbathe. The Auckland Green Gecko lives in scrub and forest areas, especially Kanuka and Manuka, also known as tea tree.

Quote: The Lyttelton waterfront has been working under the bureau system of engaging labour for nine years now. ... `And,' the bureau manager said, `the men wouldn't like to go back to the old way again.' Under the old system, foremen of the various shipping companies stood on a small platform or block with the men awaiting employment before them and nominated those they required to work their own ships. The trouble with this `auction block' system, as it was called, was that each company tended to give preference to a certain group of men. It engaged the same men first all the time and employed others only when the preferred group were all at work. This meant very often the available work on the waterfront was not evenly shared; and that's what the bureau system tries to avoid.

I do not know whether the name is a misnomer or not; but it is a liquor that is sold in the district north of Auckland. I have never seen the stuff but I believe it to be one of the vilest concoctionswhich can possibly be imagined. I do not know what its ingredients are, but I have come across people who have seen the effect of the use of Austrian wine as a beverage, and from what I learned it is a degrading, demoralising and sometimes maddening drink to many people who useit.

Quote: In the high country calendar there is one event that, more than any other, signifies the approach of winter - the autumn muster. It is the time when the musterers and their dogs head for the tops to bring the sheep down to their wintering paddocks. It is the time when reputations are made and broken for men and dogs alike. The autumn muster epitomises the skill of the New Zealand stockman.

One of the bigger ones is our mate, the Avondale spider (<i>Delena cancerides</i>)... Here in New Zealand the Avondale spider still causes the odd stir when it suddenly appears from nowhere in the peri-domestic environment of Avondale, New Lynn and Blockhouse Bay. The species is thought to have arrived about a hundred years ago, in the stacks of Australian hardwood timber from which the Avondale racecourse building was constructed.
