Quote:  Maori names for tussock varied from region to region. In one southern dialect, <i>wi</i> was used for silver tussock (furher north the same word was applied to rushes) and <i>patiti</i> seemed to be a general term for tall tussocks, with <i>maania</i> an alternative or the word for red tussock in particular. The Maniatoto (<i>maania</i> = blood, <i>toto</i> = plain) was formerly covered in red tussock.

It is known as Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Skippy, Skipper and Skipjack because of its habit of breaking the surface when feeding. The name `Skipjack' has also been applied however to at least half-a-dozen other species.

Quote:  The verbs <i>to go snaky, to go maggoty</i> (cf U.S. <i>maggoty</i>, whimsical) [mean to show anger or annoyance]. Phrases like `mad as a maggot', `mad as a meat-axe' are obviously linked with these expressions (some though not all of which may be heard in Australia; cf. Australian <i>snake-headed,</i> annoyed); whether <i>mad</i> in the sense of angry is a survival of an English provincialism, or has been introduced from America, is not clear.

Quote:  In smoky little back parlours [in Westport] friendly little groups meet to play `forty-fives' with uproarious oaths and much heavy thumping of the table. For [100] the uninitiated it may be stated that in this game the <i>five-fingers</i> (the five of the trump suit) beats all other cards. The trump suit order is five, jack, ace, king queen - all other suits begin with the king. Non-trump suits win high in red; low in black. Obviously the ace of diamonds is the lowest card in the pack unless diamonds are trumps, in which case it is the fourth best. The word "obviously' in the preceding sentence is a little optimistic - as the ace of hearts (the Maggy) is always the third best trump. It is credibly reported (a) that the game is of Irish origin (b) that there are no written rules (c) that the game can only be learned by playing it, and (d) it is as charactistic of Westport as whitebait or coal.

Quote:  Generally  known  simply  as magistrates (or SMs) they were legally qualified and exercised increasingly important judicial functions in magistrates courts  These had a general jurisdiction - civil, criminal and domestic - that set them apart from English magistrates courts which mainly dealt with petty crime and were presided over by justices of the peace. Magistrates courts were renamed district courts and their presiding judges district court judges in 1981, but the term magistrate in New Zealand denoted stipendiary magistrates rather than justices of the peace, who were and are usually referred to simply as justices or JPs.

Quote:  In this land two infections assail all comers and vie with one another for first place. These are known as Malaria and Balkan Tap respectively. On the first we need not dwell, but a little information about the latter may be of interest. A similar infection has been met with elsewhere, and in Gyppo Land is known as `magnune', whilst away in our own sunny island I think `dippy' about covered it. Here we have a more or less insidious form of the disease, and no one with six months' residence to his credit may hope to escape. There are two varieties of the disease, malignant and benign. In the latter form the symptoms are easily recognised, and are amenable to treatment; but with the malignant type the victims, quite unconscious of infection, blindly affirm their condition to be normal, This form of the malady has several unfortunate features and is incurable. The percentage in our unit is very high.

Quote:  In 1851 a number of Australian `squatters' came over and took up runholding in Canterbury, but, generally speaking, their advent was some years later in Otago. ... They brought over a number of Australian aborigine words that were new to this side, and which were used a certain amount, usually in a joking manner as far as I know. I have heard some of them fairly frequently used by the `old hands,' sometimes oracularly and sometimes as a semi-humorous quotation. When I was a boy I heard sheep called `jumbucks,' an Australian aborigine term for them, but with the decease of ex-Australian stockmen the word has gone out of use now. Another term brought over from Australia was `maimai,' for a rough shelter from the weather. It was said to be a name for a blackfellow's camp, which I have always seen spelt `miamia,' and which is called `gunyah' or `wurley,' etc., by some tribes. We now apply the name to shooting shelters.

This is a wild man of the woods, strong, cunning, and mischievous, and addicted to running off with young people and damsels. His body is covered with coarse and long hair, which also flows down from the back of his head nearly to his heels. To com-[263]pensate for this excessive quantity behind, his forehead is said to be bald. He was vividly described to us by a Maori who had seen one long ago, when he was a little boy, and was of opinion that `there is not a more fearful wild-fowl that your <i>mairoero</i> living.'

Quote:  It would probably take a scholarly thesis, however, to examine the way that Crump first popularised, then personified and finally parodied the Man Alone myth that has run though this country's literature like a strand of No. 8 wire... "The notion of the Man Alone figure goes way back to the 19th century and to a certain extent it occurs in Australian writing as well; so he comes out of a long tradition, really... The coup de grace was the Toyota ad campaign of the 80s and 90s in which Man Alone tackled the wilderness in a Japanese car.

Quote:  Could he do something about the title, as <i>Talking of War</i>, just a the moment, seemed that bit too ambiguous. "In consultation with my chief reader," Kerby wrote, "and bearing in mind the fact that Hitler is master of Europe, [192] what did he think of either 'A man Alone', or 'Escape from Death'? The editor felt the former was the one to go for. ... The title Muligan settled on for the novel has at times been remarkably misread. In his own country, the phrase 'man alone' became a glib response to what is supposed to define an aspect of national maleness, what Orsman's <i>Dictionary of New Zealand English,/i> designates 'a type (or stereotype) of the independent outdoors New Zealander.' It is as though the novel is assumed to celebrate Johnson's raw struggle with land and society, and that Muligan proposed that experience as asdmirably defining.

Quote:  Mana - `prestige' - but actually much more than this. It includes charisma, power, control and influence. People can accrue mana by means of birth, leadership qualities increasingly shown, knowledge, and the ability to increase the prestige of all things Maori. Increasing age may bring mana. It is earned, though sometimes given by a group to someone or to a tribe beacause of actions deemed to be worthy of them. Loss of mana is a loss of one's dignity and sense of worth. Total loss of mana could mean loss of life's meaning.

In developing pumice country a great saving can be effected in clearing costs if the manuka and manaoa scrub are burnt standing two or three years ahead of cultivation. Dense manaoa scrub is difficult and costly to clear in its green state, but it carries a fire well and its burnt stubs soon rot.

In kauri forest these tough wiry leaves wind round trees and shrubs in an impenetrable network. Such a tangle makes thin strong vines suitable for securing thatch on a whare, as wire might be used today.

Notes: There seems to be no Manpower Act or Manpower Regulations as such. What we had instead were various amendments to the National Service Emergency Regulations promulgated first in 1940, when they referred mainly to the Services and spoke of Placement Officers and which I suspect were the "Manpower  Regulations" of the time.  The first relevant regulation seems to be 1942 Statutory Regulations 5/19 The National Service Emergency Regulations 1940, Amendment No. 8: There shall from time to time be appointed.. such number of District Man-power Officers as may be required. Ibid. 21. In any essential undertaking..

Quote:  When in a hurry, or feeling orthographically tired, he [the southerner] calls the big manuka `kaikatoa.' A southern Maori once said to me:- `We did not pronounce the word manuka like some northerners who throw the accent forward and say `man-u-ka,' nor like the bushmen, who say `m'nooka,' but about halfway between these two pronouncing each part clearly as mah-nook-a.' Unless my hearing deceives me this throws the emphasis on the central syllable while leaving the first syllable clearly pronounced. It is a remarkable fact that while the manuka is so common its name is so seldom used in the composition of place-names.

Quote:  <i>ma[a]nuka</i>, a shrub (Leptospermum scoparium), commonly called tea-tree, because Cook's people used the fresh young leaves infused for tea; but very often mis-spelt ti-tree - ti being something totally different, the cabbage tree (Cordyline). The tree-manuka is kanuka, with smaller leaves and smaller flowers than the scrub-manuka, and it is the kanuka that is usually sold for firewood. I spoke to a dealer about it, and he said they dodged the confusion by selling it as T.T. There is a crimson-flowering variety of manuka known in England as a rarity, but by means of slips (not seed) it has become not uncommon. The starry-flowered manuka would have been adopted as the national flower but for the fact that it is too prolific, and apt to become a nuisance. It has a second name, kahika[a]toa but that is discouraged on account of its spelling being so nearly the same as kahikatea, the white pine, though in sound they are quite different, the macron in hahika[a]toa causing an apparent accent which, when observed, clearly differentiates the two words: it is not an accent, however, but a lengthening of the vowel.

[fn] The blight is caused by the action of a small sucking insect which feeds on the sap of the manuka and which secretes large quantities of a clear sticky substance known as `honey-dew'. A black sooty mould forms on this secretion. A combination of sap loss and mould slowly kills the plant.

Quote:  Again, the word Maori for these [Otaki] people has taken on a secondary meaning when it is used as an adjective referring to any object that is broken, dilapidated, hard to use, or about which people are so casual that it does not function efficiently. Thus a `Maori' door is one on which the catch is broken or which fits so badly that it blows open in the wind. ... A `Maori' gate is always a weird contraption made of bits of wire, string, parts of an old iron bedstead - something so complicated that it defies the ingenuity of the non-expert either to open or close. The owner of the gate jokes about his `Maori' gate. He is rarely sufficiently concerned ever to make a simple workable gate.

Notes: There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i> was fresh-water, oridinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.) The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers.

Quote:  This raises the question of what we mean by the term Maori. Why should Kupe be termed a Maori, if (according to Maori tradition) he was a Society Islands voyager of some 1,000 years ago who touched at New Zealand in the course of exploring voyages and returned to his homeland? By what greater right can we apply the term to Toi who arrived from the same part of the Pacific 200 years later to settle in New Zealand, or to the numerous voyagers subsequent to Toi and culminating in the Hawaiki Fleet of 1350? Every immigrant from tropical Polynesia did not become a Maori the moment he stepped ashore in New Zealand. The culture which we have come to know as Maori was undoubtedly the end product of a long period of local development, probably not reaching its final perfection of form until after the visit of Tasman. The use of the term Maori (lit. normal, ordinary or proper) to distinguish the Polynesian inhabitants of New Zealand from the intrusive European is even more clearly a late development and certainly post-European.* [fn] Williams (1921) notes no literary use before 1850 of the Maori in its present sense. Scholefield (1945) puts its use back to 1840, in the translation of the Treaty of Waitangi. McNab, quoted by Shrimpton and Mulgan, without the reference being cited, states that its earliest use was in 1818.

Quote:  (Profesor Joan Metge) Recent letters opposing the use of the word `Pakeha' claim that it means `foreigner' or `stranger'. ... Whatever the word meant when it was first bestowed, it has taken on a new and special meaning. Maoris today use it to identify non-Maori New Zealanders of European and especially of British stock, people whom they recognise as having a history of residence and commitment to this country.

Maoris use it not only to distinguish Pakehas from themselves but to couple them with themselves. The word has meaning only within the New Zealand context, in relation to and partnership with `Maori', the shared reference point being the land of Aotearoa/New Zealand.

Recommendations were therefore made to enable one member of the family to have, by communal aggreement in the Native Land Court, a definite area of the land held within the

Definition:  an aboriginal or native New Zealander; pertaining to the Maori. Spg <i>Mouri, Mauri, Mawnee</i>, [? typographical or transcription error], in the earliest texts; <i>mouray Mao[diereis]ri Maori</i> from at least 1842 (with occasional lower case m.) Plural. Mauries, Mauris, Mouries, Maories; Mauri, Mouri, Maori. The plural <i>Maories</i> can be found in written texts to the 1870's or 1880's; and is not uncommon in informal written English today, though usually regarded as a spelling error. The plural <i>Maori</i> has been usual among those with knowledge of Maori; and among those who are sensitive to Maori usage or feeling.

<i>Synonyms.</i> Leaving aside the very early (Cook, Banks) <i>Indian </i>q.v., early writers used <i>native</i> (as n and aj.) or <i>New Zealander </i>q.v. as the preferred terms, with<i> aborigine</i> q.v. being common in early writing asociated with `imperial' agencies as the Colonial Office and the Church Missionary Society, and was reinforced by the early appointment of a <i>Protector of Aborigines</i>. Early uses of <i>Maori</i> were usually tagged with an explanatory `native"; and indeed <i>Maori </i>did not replace <i>Native</i> in official use until 1947 when the name of the Department of Native Affairs was replaced by `Maori Affairs'.

Quote:  <i>Maori, n.</i> (pronounced so as to rhyme with <i>Dowry</i>). (I) The name used to designate themselves by the Polynesian race occupying New Zealand when it was discovered by the white man, and which still survives. They are not aboriginal as is commonly supposed, but migrated into New Zealand about 500 years ago from Hawaii, the tradition still surviving of the two great canoes <i>Arawa</i> and <i>Tainui</i> in which the pioneers arrived. They are commonly spoken of as the <i>Natives</i> of New Zealand. -->(2) The language of the Maori race. -->(3) Applied to anything pertaining to the Maoris or their language. See Pakeha.

-->There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other

quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i>was fresh-water, ordinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.)

The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers.

They always go on foot, and we saw several traces of their encampments - little <i>mimis</i>, as they are called - a few light sticks thrown together, and covered with grass, affording a sort of half-and-half shelter for a single individual.

Quote:  There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i> was fresh-water, oridinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.) The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers.

Quote:  We roasted half a sheep in a Maori copper, that is first dig a hole in the ground in proportion to the thing you want to cook. Line the bottom and sides with stones as big as a breakfast cup then light a fire over them till they are quite red hot throwing in more loose stones to put on the top. Then take out all the ashes, wrap your meat in green grass put it in the pit, throw the loose stones on top and cover the whole with sods of grass, clay or anything that will keep the steam in, three or four hours will cook your meat to perfection.

For more than half a century the `Maori ear' had been regarded in medical practice as a most unrewarding condition to treat in more ways than one and by both parties concerned, the report said. If future generations of Maori children retained their greater susceptibility to ear disease, every year would add to the size of the problem till it might become too big ever to be solved.

It is true that he has limited access to the wide range of expressions that enrich the English language, but `Maori English' is perhaps excessively idiomatic in its use of colloquial phrases, slang, and short, pithy expressions that convey more meaning than is in bare words. The range is not wide , however, and the expressions are used repetively, often to reinforce a meaning rather than add to it.

Notes: Jim Cameron writes: The legal definition of Maori land in DNZE is confusing. <i>Maori customary land</i> is land held in accordance with tikanga Maori. <i>Maori freehold land</i> is essentially (there are minor qualifications) land that has been converted to English freehold tenure and has not been alienated to non-Maori. There are several trusts for various forms of Maori landholding - <i>ahi whenua trusts, kitiakai trusts, putea trusts, whanau trusts</i> and <i>whenua topu trusts</i>. Note also <i> status orders</i>. See Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993.

Quote:  Maori land and the terms relating to it are of course unique to New Zealand. DNZE defines it (in part) as land for which Maori customary or legal title is recognised as valid. This has a circular air and the contrast of customary and legal tile is confusing, since customary title is itself a title recognised by the law.  At law, Maori land is land owned by Maori under customary or Maori freehold title.

Quote:  The Maori Potato The ancient potato cultivars commonly referred to as Maori potatoes may be descended from tubers given to the Maori by early explorers, or they may have come direct from South America with the early colonisation of the Pacific. Doug Yen ... now at the Bishop Museum appears to have been the first to collect and study these early potatoes (<i>The Potato Journal summer 1961/61:</i> 2-5) and he refers to the introductions by de Surville in 1769 and 1772 and by Cook in 1773. Yen also refers to the possible introduction direct from South America, since Callao in Peru and Acapulco in Mexico were provisioning ports for whaling vessels. This year I grew `Urenaka' (Yen refers to `Urenika') ... and I understand this cultivar came from the East Coast. It is certainly an unusual potato with purplish stems and tubers. ... Yen ... notes that they resemble the storied (Iodine) potato of Ireland, used as a talisman against illness. ... Audrey [Eagle] said that when she gave some [similar] tubers to a Maori lady she exclaimed `ah, rokekuri'.

Quote:  This delicacy of the English-speaking world is referred to in other circles as `shark and taties', `Maori roast', or `greasies' - understanding all depends on knowing the convention. Once the convention is established, it is just a matter of stating one's preference for two meat patties and a scoop, over a stuffed frankfurter.

What was distinctive about Maori showbands, apart from their Maoriness, was the versatility. Members had to be able to mime, dance and do comedy skits as well as sing and play several instruments... But the audience still gets what she describes as the "pure showband" routine, which means frequent instrument and costume changes and lost of comedy (Shirley Bassey and the Bee Gees are favoured spoof subjects) in between the straight songs.

It is then considered to be a Maori sickness - a `mate Maori' as the phrase is commonly used - and for sure, safe, and quick results, treatment should be referred to a Maori expert, a tohunga, either male or female, who will use a combination of religious prayer, seance-possession, and magic to restore the sick person to health. The inner bark [of <i>M. fulgens</i>] was also boiled and the liquid was drunk for `Maori sickness'.

Quote:  The phrase "Maori time" has not been abroad much of late, but recent events have highlighted a linguistic gap that it will fill very neatly. Maori time is a period of 12 days, or the length of time that elapses between a major disaster and the government's getting around to doing something about it when that disaster affects a predominantly Maori community, say, in the Far North.

A small rental will be charged, and stringent conditions as to occupancy will be enforced.   The right of transfer will be limited to other Natives, and all precautions will be taken to prevent a transfer to Europeans.   The system will be applied especially to the South Island Natives, many of whom are said to be almost homeless.   The Government will buy the land necessary for the settlement.

Quote:  Maori Wardens were appointed in 1949 as a result of the Liquor Licensing Bill 1948. Wardens were administered through the Department of Maori Affairs and nominated by tribal executives. Wardens had power over liquor and liqor-related disturbances within tribal districts, with powers over Maori pub patrons and over Pakeha at hui or if there was sly-grogging... In many ways the Maori wardens were following in the tradition of the Ringatu pirihimana, the Ratana katipa and the Kingite watene.

A young couple would decide that they wanted to become man and wife, and they would have to tell their parents they wanted this. Well, at night-time everyone would congregate in the meetinghouse [the matter would be discussed, the boy and girl would be asked whether they wanted to marry, and they would take each other in front of all their people].

Quote:  Undoubtedly there was good blood among these horses, though the great majority would come into the somewhat elastic classification of `Maori weed.' In actual fact, there was no reproach in the term, Born and reared on the inhospitable plains, a horse developed a stamina that no finely-bred animal possessed. Well broken in and handled properly, a `weed' would get through more hard toiling in a day than the average equine would put behind him in a week. Looks might be against him, but for downright hard work in the high hill country he had the goods, as they say, and with something to spare.

Quote:  To a certain extent, in fact, <i>Maoritanga</i> is not a matter of inheritance; it is a matter of

<i>he manawa</i>, of `how one feels.' <i>Ibid.</i> 75 But when Sir James Carroll and other leaders of the Young Maori Party wanted a term to denote the way of life of their people, they took the completely-assimilated modern meaning of the word `Maori' - which, thanks to the <i>pakeha</i>, transcended tribal boundaries - and coined a new meaning for `Maoritanga.' The meaning of the term is debated and discussed, analyzed and defined, used and abused with great frequency in the present upsurge of interest in Maori culture and traditional ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. A second Maori renaissance seems to be under way, aided by this all-embracing term and strengthened by the success of the first one in the early decades of this century.

The front of the marae is called the atea (from `Te mare nui atea o Tu matauenga' - the big marae of Tu, the god of war). Marae are places where the Maori may assert his/her uniqueness and culture, and are used for tangi, feasts, meetings, weddings and many other reasons.

Quote:  It provides a perfect metaphor for both the subject and the persona dramatis of this absorbing, well-researched book focusing on the Maramatanga movement, a Maori belief system that grew out of a desire to incorporate the ancient tohunga ways with the teachings of the New Testament... Based around the Ruapehu area and stretching as far as the Whanganui River area, the Maramatanga is a unique series of beliefs. Although the majority of its practitioners belong to the Roman Cathlic branch of Christianity, the teaching of Rikiriki, who was both a prophet and a healer, are designed to being together the old and the new, rather than the outright rejection of the old ways preferred by most Protestant missionaries.

Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.

Notes: It seems the trail leads back to Aucklandabout 1924 at earliest, first real exhibition probably 1926; competitions between various factories in the clothing trade. The restrictions on uniforms mentioned below were brought in to prevent big firms outspending the smallones by providing splendiferous uniforms. Organisations outside the rag trade do not seem to have been allowed in officially into Interhouse Marching until about 1954.  Despite the evidence below that it started in Auckland under Jean Stevenson, Bateman's Encyclopedia says marching started in Wellington and spread to Auckland later.  It must be wrong. The plot thickens. Passing through London Bookshop today I spotted Gordon Ell's new book on NZ Trivia and Kiwiana and he says Marching Girls started in Dunedin in the 1920s. have I found any early Auckland ones, nothing before 1941 in Wellington. guess is that one or other or both of Jean Stevenson and Kathleen Montgomery started them in Auckland and through the YWCA spread them rapidly throughout the main centres.

was started in Auckland by Miss Jean

Stevenson, General Secretary of the YWCA

in Auckland in the early 1920s. The idea

was to give some recreation to girls who

did not favour the robust sports of

hockey or basketball... In due course, marching competitions came

to Wellington... You can tell  a marching girl by the way

she carries herself - and by the absence

of round shoulders... The Wellington Inter-house Marching

Association was formed with rules

governing costume to allow the

participants to take part in running and

ball-relay events as well as marching.

Notes: Jim writes: Introduced to NZ about 1901 and imported until 1924, after which they were made locally. See Salmond <i>Old NZ Houses</i> p 122 etc. An account of the development of the Marseilles tile roof in Australia is in Robin Boyd <i>Australia's Home</i> p. 151-153. Despite its European name and the original provenance of the tile, this term is not in British dictionaries I have seen. NSOD has only <i>Marseille ware</i> - a type of pottery produced in Marseilles during the 17th and 18th centuries. DEH adds: researching family geneology, I encountered a ship from Marseilles via Genoa to Sydney or NZ in 1909 from Marseille with a cargo of tiles. Many Kelburn houses have Marseilles tiles

<i>New Zealand</i>. They were given by an old Maori Chief in 1913, with the injunction that they must always be worn when the ship was in action, the chief prophesying that they would keep the ship from harm. Both "Piu-piu' and `Tiki' were worn at the Battle of Jutland by the Captain - to the great satisfaction of the crew, who, it is told, before the battle began took special measures to find out that the Captain was actually wearing the ship's mascot. On another occasion, when an action seemed imminent, the <i>New Zealand</i> mascot was also worn. On that occasion, word was specially passed round the decks among the men - `It's all right, he's got 'em on!' The <i>New Zealand</i> at Jutland escaped with only one shell hit, and had no casualties. Writing home after Jutland an officer said: "This ship bore a charmed life and suffered to the smallest extent though we were right in it the whole time.'

The Maori name is <i>Tumatakuru</i>, of which <i>Matagory</i>, with various spellings, is a corruption, much used by rabbiters and swagmen. The termination <i>gory</i> evidently arises by the law of Hobson-Jobson from the fact that the spikes draw blood.

Quote:  In the rip-roaring times of the King Country, Matai beer was a favourite with those who were strong enough and tough enough to drink it. It went out of favour when `cruisers' for the various timber mills complained that much good yellow pine was being ruined through the number of deep axe cuts and even auger holes in the standing trees, made to let the potent juice run into waiting pannikins or buckets. The favourite recipe for this form of wood alcohol represented the addition of three or four cupsful of the sap to each gallon of `ordinary' liquid refreshment. That the resultant mixture had a pretty hefty kick to it may be judged from this description handed in to the Taihape newspaper (1912): `Matai beer is the term used to describe a certain brand or grade of alcoholic brew. It may be identified easily. It smells like an ancient bar room the morning after. It tastes like used machine oil, only a very low grade of machine oil.

Quote:  But [bushmen] used to make concoctions of their own, and the most popular ... was matai beer. ... When you felled a big matai, a really mature black pine ... you would see the main artery in the heart of the tree gushing out the life liquid. ... It wasn't the sap; this was not related to that. It was a pure clear liquid, and it gushed out like the main artery gushing blood. But that used to be prized, and it would be caught in a billy. That was really something. It was beautiful and cool and sweet to drink as it was, but some of the blokes used to bung in maybe a handful of raisins and sugar and cork her up and let her ferment, and whether that fluid had any other properties in it or not I don't know, but you could get quite a potent drink from it.

Apparently when the tree was being cut down the watery sap was collected, more water was added and also some ordinary beer, or yeast. It was left to ferment and was reputed to be quite strong though I have not been able to find any written evidence of this.

Quote:  But what is Matariki and why has this ancient tradition, which hasn't been much practised by

Maori for the past 150 years, suddenly taken off again? Matariki is the Maori name for the beautiful little cluster of stars that is commonly known as the Pleiades or the Seven Sisters, Roughly translated, it means "little-eyes".... At the end of May, Matariki reappears in the morning sky, rising just before dawn... So Matariki is linked to the universal celebration of midwinter. It's the antipodean equivalent of the Scots' hogmanay or the Chinese New Year - in fact it has traditions that go back further than the Roman Saturnalia.

Notes: Kolstad says there was an entry of "matchhead moss" <i> Cladonia cristatella</i>) written but not included in Vol.3 of Dictionary of American Regional English. Kerry Carman (Sep. 2000) writes : This is a very localised Southland/Otago colloquialism for the Grape Hyacinth <i>Muscari armeniacum</i>. The only literary reference I can give you, apart from Frame, is from Invercargill writer Olive Dunn's <i>Delights of Colour in a New Zealand Garden </i>p. 16. Other Southern writers such as Essie Summers also use the term I am told but I can not supply a reference. The origin remains a mystery but it may stem from the old blue topped wax Vesta matches. Dianne Bardsley says she knew the term well from the Wairarapa, but it is not known in Taranaki.

I gave him the information required, and asked him to come and stay with me for the night, which he did. ... He found it there the next day. I came upon him working in the creek, when he sang out: `Hullo, mate! - I have got him.' And so he had. Both of us worked hard for a week or so, and got a few ounces with a tin dish. Read stayed with me during the time. He wanted me go `mates' with him and find him in `tucker', and we would keep it quiet for a few months;

It is then considered to be a Maori sickness - a `mate Maori' as the phrase is commonly used - and for sure, safe, and quick results, treatment should be referred to a Maori expert, a tohunga, either male or female, who will use a combination of religious prayer, seance-possession, and magic to restore the sick person to health.

Quote:  The Matuku (<i>Botaurus poiciloptilus</i>) is a bittern, long-legged and billed. ... The Maori are expert at catching them but I cannot say that bittern meat is good. There is a smaller species of bittern, a blue heron, and possibly others of the family, all known under the common name of matuku.

When the Pakeha mentions the matuku he always refers to the bittern; the other he always calls blue-heron.

Quote:  Mauri - ethos, life-force or principle, life-style, belief. This term applies to both animate an inanimate things. Houses, land, trees, forests, buildings, hills etc. can have a life-force of their own. So can the front (atea) of a marae, a speech, the kumara, or the taniwha of a river. Maoris strongly believe in mauri, and just as a life force may wax or wane depending on a person's health or status, so can his or her `mauri'. Lack of mauri can cause a person to die.

Quote:  [Hdg] The quarter-acre section has been replaced by the quarter-acre house that critics are calling the McMansion... This is the official flop of the nation's pavlova paradise, a place where the largest house is erected on the smallest site for the lowest price in the shortest time. The critics call it McMansion land, mock-palaces for the masses... So the McMansion is a trophy house? "It probably is," agrees Halsey.

They have a verandah at the entrance with a carved gabled front and are richly decorated inside, with patterned reed panels, with black and white painted scrolls on the rafters, and with carvings or paintings of ancestors and incidents in the mythological history of the people on whose marae the meeting-house is built. Supporting the ridge-pole is a centre-post on which are figures of ancestors. The floor is often covered with flax matting, and visitors take off their shoes before entering. Another meeting house is described in the first part of `Hemi's Daughter'.

These species have adapted very well to growing in a harsh environment but have become so specialised they are dificult to grow elsewhere. <i>Anisotome latifolia</i> is an example of one of these megaherbs.

Whatever its initial NZ currency the phrase is general NZE and not special to Southland as sometimes suggested.

Quote:  The New Zealanders are very religious men. Their priests lead them out to a quiet spot where they can pray. The priest spreads out a holy mat with marks on it which means something they have great faith in. He kneels down beside the mat, then a row of worshippers kneel all round him, with another row bending over them, and another row standing behind them. The worshippers throw their offerings on to the holy mat, and the priest places two coins on a short piece of polished wood which he calls a kip, and raising his eyes to the sky, he throws up the coins as an offering to Allah. All the worshippers raise their eyes also to the sky, and then bow solemnly over the mat, and say together, `God Almighty', and the priest answers, `A pair of Micks', which means that the offerings are not accepted, or he may say, `Oh Lord, he has done 'em again', and the joyful cries of some of the worshippers show that Allah is pleased, and so they, too, are glad.

Launched less than a year ago, the miha, which is a young ponga frond, is to be let to wither and die. For three years the Export Institute wrestled with the concept of a new national emblem which would uniquely identify New Zealand goods and services.

Quote:  Hamilton Beach's deco brackets, their pods poised above gleaming mixer arms that de;ivered milkshakes in cool, tall aluminium beakers, were the heart of the milk bar at a time when milk was the cool drink. So cool that heavy dudes, Harley riders, even, were known as milk bar cowboys and jukebox music was eroding the moral fabric of the nation. Great milk bars were places of style and social consequence when pubs were slop houses and restaurants served no wine; serious places that demanded serious drinking, and there was nothing more serious than a milkshake.

Quote:  During the early months of this year [1956] much publicity was given in the Christchurch newspapers to the fact that large numbers of young people were to be seen, especially at the weekends, in the central areas of the city. These young people congregated in the streets and milk-bars. Many of them had motor-cycles ... At various times these young people were referred to as `Teddy Boys', `Milk Bar Cowboys' and `Bodgies and Widgies'. <i>Ibid.</i> 2 Milk Bar Cowboys show more individual variation in their dress, and do not display the cleanness and neatness of the Teddy Boy. Leather jackets and trousers tucked into the tops of high wool-lined boots are common. Their interests centre round motor-cycles and cars; many wear one or more of the badges issued by motor-cycle manufacturers. Youths of this type are common in the Christchurch streets at the week-end. It is worth noting that whereas the name of Teddy Boy is accepted proudly, that of Milk Bar Cowboy is not. Boys who appear to conform to this type will repudiate the label.

Quote:  <i>Caving method</i>: Also known as the `milking cow'; it applied to an area of several acres where the Mine Lake is now. The method started with the collapse of the large arches on the Martha reef about No. 1 shaft, and was later systematically developed by a series of sub-levels on Nos 7, 8 and 9 levels which were used to weaken this section of country and cause it to run so that it could be drawn off through chutes. It operated for a quarter-century and is conservatively estimated to have yielded over a million tons of good run-of-mine grade ore. <i>Ibid.</i> 327 <i>Milking Cow or Caving Block</i>: (See also caving method). A block of country between Nos 1 and 6 shafts and Junction Road, where the Mine Lake is now, which originally contained a network of large reefs and which collapsed after the removal of undergound support pillars and arches and became a caving area. It is estimated that over 1,000,000 tons of ore of good grade was obtained on Nos 7 and 8 levels by caving methods during a period of 25 years.

Definition: In New Zealand until quite recently (Ministry of Works, 19 ), only the former of the two main `governmental' senses of Ministry was commonly used: OED 5 from 1710, the body of ministers forming the government' eg. the Seddon ministry, etc. As the name of a Stare department (OED 6, from 1877) it was introduced when the name of the `Public Works Department (see P.W.D.) was for various reasons changed to Ministry of Works. Since then the reorganisation and extension of responsibilities of the Transport Department has given a new Ministry of Transport. -->`Ministry' is felt to be a more inclusive (perhaps grander) name than `department' in the NZ State Services system. (Based partly on a note by R. Mason) -->cf EWD 5.

For a long time it has been known to the Maori and to Europeans that our New Zealand Whitebait is the young of a native freshwater fish commonly known as Minnow, or Inanga or Hiwi to the Maori, and erroneously called a Trout. ... The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. In the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.

Quote:  The manager of an adjoining station once told me that he saw about 5,000 Merino ewes and lambs yarded on one occasion by an inexperienced man, and about 200 were smothered before the men started tailing. Then they let the ewes and lambs out on to a big block,

<i>yard by yard as they finished,</i> the result being that fully 500 lambs were mis-mothered, some of the ewes being miles away before the mob was through.

The fact is, they are all whether converted or unconverted, radically bad - and it is my own opinion as well as that of every one else whom I have conversed with on the subject, that no permanent good can be done among them until they are placed under a power, which shall be at once their terror, their protection, and their model.

Upland moa were agile, 1.2 metre-high ostrich-like birds, the New Zealand equivalent of mountain goats.

Quote:  THE [AUTHOR'S] USE OF THE TERM MOA-HUNTER [heading] [XII] ... Because this hunting economy and imported artifact styles coincided with the then unknown period of the extermination of the Moa in particular, Skinner, Duff and Buck revived the term Moa-hunter Maori to distinguish the first phase of ecological adaptation from the climax Classic Maori phase of the eighteenth century, with such new elements as agriculture, the fortified village, warfare, and artifact styles evolved within New Zealand. [XII] The term Moa-hunter follows the practice in culture-phase designation of coining a label of contrast. Although Moa-hunter Maoris gathered shell-fish and hunted all available birds, fish, seals and small whales, the cultural and economic phase is conveniently designated from the Moa as the largest and most spectacular game animal available during man's first adaptation to the environment and the one no longer available in the Classic Maori era. The term Moa-hunter is preferred here to the longer `Archaic Phase of New Zealand East Polynesian', too easily corrupted to `Archaic Maori', with `Archaic' meaning only `early'.

He concludes that, although some coastal sites are immense and must represent the slaughter of many thousands of moa, "moa-hunting was generally a temporary, perhaps seasonal, activity" which seldom provided more than a quarter to a half of the moa-hunters' total sustenance... His broad conclusion is that moa-hunting occurred between the 11th and 17th centuries, but peaked early in the 123th century in most areas.

Quote:  Little further field activity could be recorded other than continued work in the Pyramid Valley moa-swamp and the demonstration that one of the last of a colony of anomalously surviving `bush' moas (<i>Megalapteryx</i>) had been killed in the Fiordland hinterland of Lake Te Anau, by a Maori fowling party of the eighteenth century.

Quote:  We come now to the `moa theory' elaborated by Greenwood and Atkinson, which has found favour with some but disbelief from others. ... Essentially, Greenwood and Atkinson propose that the divaricating shrub habit is probably unique to New Zealand and results from an environmental factor that was also unique ..., namely the moas. [Divaricate habit prevented moa browsing.]

Quote:  <i>Woolshed terms.</i>-The <i>water pot</i> is a tin of water (usually disinfected) which a shearer has tied by him to wet his shears in. To <i>gap</i> shears is to make (accidentally) a g. in the edge. <i>Sweat rag:</i> kept by the shearer to wipe his brow. <i>To grind</i> (shears) is always used without the noun. A shearer never `grinds his shears.' <i>Moccasins</i> are the sacking slippers which most shearers make to work in. Unless the owner of the station is a careful, observant man, he will hardly recognise his own wool pack tops.

Quote:  <i>tui</i>, a bird (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), the most characteristic of the smaller Maori birds, kept by the Maori as a pet and by them taught to speak, it being an excellent mimic, and so by the settlers called the mocking-bird, shortened to mockie, and called parson-bird because of the two white curled tufts of feathers at its throat. Then, because some folk thought mockie was short for makomako, a name of the bell-bird (korimako) in some parts, some thought it was the korimako which was the mimic, and hence both birds have been called the mocking-birds.

The largest of them span more than two metres in diameter and weigh over seven tonnes.[15] Claims have been made that the Moeraki boulders are the only rocks of their kind in the world... The truth is that concretions are common, but are usually only a few centimetres in diameter, irregular in shape and unlikely to impress... To Moeraki's Ngai Tahi residents, the boulders' origin is intertwined with the arrival of kumara from distant Hawaiki. According to Te Rungana o Moeraki, the great waka Arai-Te-Uru was wrecked during a fierce storm at Matakaea (Shag Point), just south of Moeraki. The boulders are food baskets that washed ashore after being thrown overboard to lighten the load. The Katiki concretions are said to be kumara tubers and seeds from the same wreck.

(false). The circumstances naturally caused much merriment among my audience, and quite upset the gravity of the venerable old chief Nepia Taratoa. `Friend,' said he, laughing, `your arguments are very good; but my <i>mokai</i> is a very wise bird, and he is not yet convinced.'

The sole difference was that some were in outline only, some were half filled in, and others were finished in elaborate detail.

Although known in nearly all parts of New Zealand by the name of Stagknife, the game was also known as Bites, Jackknife, Stabknife, Knifey, Momley Peg, and Throwing the Knife. ... There were generally two players ... who each sought to deflect the point of the pocket knife from certain parts of the body by a flick of the hand in such a way that the blade would stick firmly into the ground. ... Every movement had to be done three times. [172] Typical movements were: (1) Place the open pocket knife (loose) [name of movement] [sic] on the closed knuckles of the right hand, point the knife towards the thumb, then with a quick upward flick of the hand to the left, deflect the point of the knife into the ground.

In town where dogs are kept largely for appearance and display `mongrel' I think has only one meaning - that a dog is of mixed breeding (with a note of disapproval or contempt). In the country mongrel has two independent meanings.  (i) A dog of mixed blood. Objective - no emotional content. Indeed `pedigreed' is acquiring something of the mongrel taint, in that if a good dog has a pedigree it is mentioned with a faint note of surprise.  (ii) A `no-good' whether man or animal.  `He turned out mongrel' (Rod Macaulay speaking of a pedigreed mastiff that took to sheep worrying.)  `When Bill brought him home I knew he'd turn out a mongrel. Sort of a cow-y look about his head.' (Walter Hull discussing a pedigreed `Totara Park' Friesian bull which proved sterile.)  Talking of dogs:  An `eye-dog' is a specialised type of header which works very quietly, never taking its eyes off the sheep it is trying to pen. Sheep men generally seem to think the dog hypnotises the sheep into being penned quietly. I believe that the fixity of its gaze and its complete concentration enable it to detect and counter any rebelliousness on the part of the sheep before the sheep have quite made up their minds.

Quote:  <i>Moore filters</i>: Large `baskets' of canvas-covered filter-frames weighing about 16 tons and connected to a vacuum
Source. First the basket was lowered by an overhead electric-crane into a tank of thickened pulp, previously treated with cyanide solution for several days. The vacuum caused a layer or cake of slime one or two inches thick to build up on the frames, while the clean solution, now laden with gold and silver, was pumped to the precipitators. When the cake reached the required thickness the basket was lifted and placed in a tank of barren cyanide solution, which was sucked through the cake removing the residual gold-bearing solution. After this the basket was placed in a `wash water' tank to remove all the solution, and then it was lifted and placed over the discharge bay; the vacuum was then released, allowing the cake to fall off (with some encouragement from a wooden scraper) into a waste sluice. [328] This process was repeated at about two-hourly intervals, with several bays working at the same time.

Quote:  <i>Mopoke, n.</i> aboriginal name for an Australian bird, from its note `Mopoke.' There is emphasis on the first syllable, but much more on the second. Settlers very early attempted to give an English shape and sense to this name. The attempt took two forms, ` <i>More-pork</i>,' and <i>`Mope-hawk'</i>; both forms are more than fifty years old. The r sound, however, is not present in the note of the bird, although the form <i>More-pork</i> is perhaps even more popular than the true form <i>Mope-hawk</i> seems to have been adopted through dislike of the perhaps coarser idea attaching to `pork.' The quaint spelling <i>Mawpawk</i> seems to have been adopted for a similar reason. [1827 Tasmania]

Quote:  This passage embodies an early version of what has become known as the `Moriori myth'. Except for the name Moriori, which was borrowed from the Chatham Islands and applied by 1880 to supposed pre-Maori inhabitants of New Zealand, the theory is all here in a book published in 1877, based on material collected in the mid-1860s. A black-skinned, curly-headed people with timid dispositions, presumably negroid or Melanesian, were supposed to have been found in possession of New Zealand by the first Polynesian settlers and exterminated by them except for a few with whom they intermarried, so that their racial traits appeared from time to time among the Maoris.

Some of the largest and soundest kauri timber has richly mottled shading, which appears to be an abnormal growth, due to the bark being entangled in the ligneous growth, causing shaded parts, broad and narrow, according as the timber is cut relative to their planes. This makes a rich and valuable furniture wood, and in the market is known as `mottled kauri'.

Quote:  During Victorian times Ranunculus lyalli,

the Mt Cook or Mountain Buttercup, was

known in England as the "Rockwood

Lily."... The exact connection between

the "Rockwood Lily" and a Canterbury

sheep station presents an interesting

puzzle... Rockwood Station, owned by

Henry Phillips, was one of the earliest

established homesteads... However, the

precise connection with Rockwood.. has

yet to be discovered.

The name is [167] most inappropriate, as the plant is not a lily, but a large white buttercup. However, any large-leaved herbaceous native plant is called by the colonists a lily, especially if it has white flowers.

Apparently the first is given to <i>Raoulia  tenuicaulis</i>, one of the scabweeds, by Heretaunga Tramping Club. No doubt plenty of Tararuas have used it with sand or ashes to clean out a billy, little thinking that their actions might inspire a new plant name, given to it by Canterbury mountaineers apparently, from the tufts of leaves at the ends of the branches.

In origin, the Mounted Riflemen date back to the 'sixties, when that fine soldier, Major Sir Harry Atkinson, formed the settler-riflemen into a mounted force of a nature demanded by the topographical and tactical conditions of the fiercely-contested Maori wars.

The same term is applied in the North Island equally to the whole plant, and to the dried flower-stem when cut for rafts or other purposes; or exclusively to the flower-stalk. In the North [83] Island, the Flax-plant is also known as `Harakeke,' or `Herekiakia,' - its usual name there. ... The lower part of the flower-stem is `Kaikaha;' the outer part of the leaf `Parakoka;' [a1, o-macron] the refuse of the leaf `Hunga-hunga;' the flax, dressed or not, or scraped fibre, manufactured from the leaf, `Whitau,' or `Muka.'

Quote:  Under his tutelage New Zealand learned to live beyond its means as it had never done before, to such an extent that nobody seems to know quite how large its total foreign debt has become, except that it is certainly huge and may be a per capita world record. Its welfare state, which has often been held up as an example to the world, was allowed to swell as its traditional and all-important agricultural markets shrank. As the budget deficit widened, Sir Robert became an apparently immovable fixture, the political Mr Micawber of the southern hemisphere. Now the voters have awoken to the unreal nature of what long since became known to them as `Muldoonism', its creator and chief exponent could not bring himself to accept his stinging defeat, like many another unseated authoritarian before him.

The boats were designed for a specific purpose, the netting of mullet which abound in the shallow tidal reaches, creeks and estuaries of the Hauraki Gulf, and its environs.

But I speak of the regular legalized and established system of plundering as penalty for offences, which in a rough way resembled our law by which a man is obliged to pay `damages'.

Notes: (The word seems to have been introduced to Canterbury) Acland (1933) notes the following musters on high-country stations. -->So far as I know the usual ones are (beginning in the spring): <i>the cutting and tailing muster; shearing</i> muster; <i>straggle</i> muster (in the old days the shorn sheep were always turned not before the country .us;was straggled, <i>so that they would lead the woolies in); dipping or wearing </i>m.; <i>straggle </i>again; then <i>scratch</i> m. or <i>`lock-over' </i>to get the last of the sheep off the summer country before winter. This last is an undress sort of muster, the men catching what stragglers they can in the basins. There are always other partical musters of the flock; e.g., ewes to ram, or eye-slipping of hoggets.

So far as I know the usual ones are (beginning in spring): the cutting and tailing <i>m.</i>; shearing <i>m.</i>; straggle <i>m.</i>(in old days the shorn sheep were always turned out before the country was straggled, so that they would lead the woolies in); dipping or weaning <i>m.</i> (to wean the lambs and dip the ewes); fall (or autumn) m.; straggle again; then scratch <i>m.</i> or `look over' to get the last of the sheep off the summer country before winter. This last is an undress sort of <i>m.</i>, the men catching what stragglers they can in the basins.

This I take to be the bird which is sometimes called the sheerwater, or the sooty petrel - a black bird about the size of a duck, with long wings, which all of us have seen on our voyage out skimming over the waves. In the month of December these birds resort to the cky islands about Foveaux's Straits in great numbers, for the purpose of breeding.

Quote:  MUTTONBIRD. Also known as the sooty shearwater or titi, the New Zealand muttonbird is <i>Puffinus griseus</i> and belongs to the order of sea birds known as petrels. As a name, `muttonbird' appears to have originated among early European settlers in Australasia and is said to refer to the taste of the flesh. At least as probable is the theory that the name refers to the rather woolly appearance of the downy young. In New Zealand other petrels are also given the name `muttonbird'. In fact, the sooty shearwater, which is most abundant on the islands about Foveaux Strait, might well be called the <i>southern</i> muttonbird, and the grey-faced petrel, predominant on the islands off the coast of Auckland Province,the <i>northern</i> muttonbird. In Victoria, Tasmania, Bass Strait, and South Australia, the species is the short-tailed shearwater - an occasional visitor to New Zealand seas.

Quote:  Muttonbirds were so called from their fancied flavour of mutton. The first known mention of the name is in a letter from an officer stationed on the newly-founded convict station on Norfolk Island. He writes in 1793 that the island swarms with muttonbirds so called by the convicts or sometimes bird sheep.
