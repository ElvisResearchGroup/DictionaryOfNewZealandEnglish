Quote: The name `cabbage-tree' was given by Captain Cook's people. ... Journal, 10th October, 1774 : `These cabbage-trees or palms were not thicker than a man's leg, and from ten to twenty feet high. They are of the same genus with the cocoa-nut tree ; like it they have very large pinnated leaves, and are the same sort as the second sort found in the northern parts of New South Wales [vide Hawkesworth Voyages Vol 3]. The cabbage is, properly speaking, the bud of the tree ; each tree producing but one cabbage which is at the crown, where the leaves spring out, and is enclosed in the stem ... -->[Cook, Voyage to Pacific Ocean 1777 Vol II pp 148-9] ... The remarks that the leaves are pinnate, that each tree produces but one cabbage, and that the cutting of it destroys the tree, lead one to suspect that the tree referred to is not a Cordyline. The entry in the Journal was made at Norfolk Island, not New Zealand, but there is no indication in Cook as to what tree is referred to. ... A more definite clue in Banks (Journal of the Rt Hon Sir Joseph Banks during Captain Cook's First Voyage ... 1768-77, London, 1896 p227), where he writes of New zealand [sic] plants ... A footnote identifies the [`cabbage-tree'] as Areca Sapida Soland. ... [Nikau] ... `very closely related to the Norfolk Island A. Baueri which is a larger plant' [Hooker]. [Banks] says nothing of the eating of the young shoots of the Cordyline. It would appear, then, that primarily the term `cabbage-tree', `cabbage-palm' was applied to Areca Baueri, but has become transferred exclusively to Cordyline ... [examples and references to Cordyline and Areca in Colenso and others] ...

Quote: One would suppose that Kirk had forgotten the origin of the name when he says, `Settlers and bushmen generally apply the unmeaning [sic] name of "cabbage-tree"' (Kirk, Forest Flora of NZ p295). Cheeseman, too, says, `Universally known to New Zealand residents by the inappropriate name of "cabbage-tree"' (Cheeseman, Manual NZ Flora p707). Thomas explains the name and errs in doing so : `It receives its name from the arrangement of its leaves in tufts or heads at the ends of the branches' (Clark A Southern Cross Fairy-tale p53). Butler remarks `The cabbage-tree or ti-palm is not a true palm, though it looks like one. It has not the least resemblance to a cabbage.' The settlers and bushmen followed Cook in using the young heart as a vegetable, and in their naming of the tree ; and when the reason for the name is known its inapproriateness disappears. To one section of the public it will always be the cabbage-tree ; to the other section, let it be lily-palm. `Ti-tree' and ti-palm' should certainly be banned, because of the hopeless confusion with tea-tree. The Canterbury form ti (-tree, -palm) is obs. Originally from Maori name for the tree, `ti', it was confused with tea-tree (`Manuka', Leptospermum sp) see Acland.

These were merino sheep living alone, and having a cabbage-tree or a flax-bush for a mate or companion; and they could not be made to leave, always keeping within a certain radius of that special tree, which they considered their especial friend ... They could never be made to associate with flock sheep.

This seems to me a commoner meaning for <i>boo-ay</i> than `backblocks', `remote rural districts', mentioned by Keith Sinclair, in the<i> Pelican History of New Zealand</i>, with suggested derivation from the settlement at Puhoi. Since the backblocks are already called the <i>woop woops</i> (the form given by Partridge who says it is mainly restricted to New South Wales: I know the word but think of it as<i> wook wooks</i>), the sticks, the tea tree and <i>the cactus</i>, some semantic differentiation is not impossible. It must be pointed out that my meaning for <i>up the boo-ay</i> is already supplied by <i> up the chute,</i> however.

In a `Calcutta' subscripters are ... 1 pound each ... and are not governed by the number of horses in the race upon which the sweep is based. Slips of paper with the horses written on then placed in a hat and in another hat - names of subscribers. Promoter ... takes role of auctioneer ... each horse drawn offered at auction and sold to highest bidder ... full amount bid has only to be paid if the buyer is not the drawer of that particular horse. If the drawer should buy the horse in, then he pays only half the amount bid, and the money goes into the pool. If the buyer does not draw the horse, the amount bid is divided, half to the drawer and half to the pool.

This was a common practice in those days and now that it seems to be a thing of the past it might be worth describing. The evening before the event concerned the crowd would get together and every dog on the programme would be put up for `auction'. The proceeds of the `sale' would be pooled, divided into first, second and third money, and after the actual event was finished this went to the men who had `purchased' the placed dogs.

Quote: [The] system, known casually as the Calcutta sweep, is practised in most clubs round the country and makes amateur golfers wealthy men through golf as an amateur sport. Basically, the idea works on the system of paired golfers who compete for prize-money put up by their fellow club-members ... The pairs are deemed horses and are bought at local club auctions by other club members. And it is at those auctions that anything happens ... The competition is usually run on a match-play basis with the winning couple collecting half of what they have won while the `owner' who bought them gets the other half ... I know of one team that went for $3 all up and won a calcutta.

Quote: The victims of calf beating, as it is called, were always attacked by hinds other than their own mothers. Calf beating does not appear to be a general pattern of behaviour in all hinds, because in some herds no deaths from this phenomenon occur. Consequently, the calf beating is thought to have been due to the high stocking rate and the lack of cover provision.

This comprised a long narrow box, open at each end but otherwise completely enclosed. Through it ran an endless canvas belt with wooden cleats fitting neatly into the inside of the box. The belt passed over rollers at the upper and lower ends of the box; the lower end was immersed in the flooded paddock and as the belt turned clockwise over its rollers the water was drawn up through the box and delivered to a tail-race. The motive power was commonly an overshot water-wheel.

It is an iron pot about fifteen inches diameter, six inches deep, with straightly sloping sides, the top being about an inch or so wider than the bottom. The lid is slightly concave on the lower side, and has a looped handle on top at the centre. The whole is either slung over the fire by means of a big, looped handle, the ends of which are loosely affixed to loops on the outer sides of the oven or stood over coals.

At the same time, any farmer who sees a new plant on his farm should look at it askance, obtain what information he can get respecting it, and eradicate it at once if he has any reason to suspect it of having the weed-assuming characteristics. [fn] This plant is a native of the British Islands, Europe generally, north Africa, and northern to western Asia. It is only naturalised in the United States, where, however, it is called the `Canada thistle.' In England it is known as the `corn thistle' and `creeping thistle,' and is a weed of either cultivated or waste ground.

Quote: I can't help noticing that, on manyoccasions, the term "Cantabrian" is usedas the adjective for Canterbury. This isnot correct. The term "Cantabrian" is thaadjective for Cambridge... Presumably,the adjective for Canterbury is"Cantaburian" or "Canterburian".

Quote: SIR, Your news item of May 11, `Unashamedly Cantabrian' quotes the chairman of a Christchurch City Council committee saying some development project was `unashamedly parochial and unashamedly Cantabrian.' -->this adjective for `pertaining to Canterbury' rouses my curiosity. The word Canterbury itself is quite capable of being used as an adjective - Canterbury bells, Canterbury gallop (hence `canter') John Brooke-White? [The following in bold type.] The `Post's' chief reader Ian Spicer says `Cantabrian' to describe a resident of, or phenomenon related to Canterbury - and more particularly Christchurch - has been around for a long time. Usage appears to be peculiar to Christchurch newspapers and some individuals, perhaps as a means of reinforcing some quaint notions held by them about the city's Englishness. Arguments about the word have waxed at least as long with Canterburians being preferred by some as being etymologically more valid. However, Canterburians looks awkward and is a mouthful to pronounce: for those reasons, Cantabrian appears to have scored the victory.

When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.

Quote: Only on one occasion in my high schooldays did my rage manifest itself. And that was very early in my first year, over the business of `capping'. Whatever capping meant (or means) elsewhere, in Greymouth it meant the ceremony by which new boys were initiated into the ways of high school by means of being belted on the rump with the rolled-up caps of older boys, peak outwards. For most Runanga boys this meant being thumped raw all the way to Greymouth on the train, and then being pushed through a tunnel of about 150 boys on the school ground and belted once again.

Quote: Cream with a black mane, the breed was evolved through Major Carlyon crossing imported Exmoor sires with local horses. They became widely known as the Carlyon ponies and are held in high repute. Later in my travels I saw a Carlyon stallion at Ahinewairua Station in the Inland Patea: it was a beautiful pony. These Carlyon horses are cream with a black mane and tail ... he has a batch of yearlings by the Carlyon horse out of draught mares ... [Carlyon horse]

Judging what's what is a matter of microns - the measurement used to rate the fineness of the fibre diameter. ... Cashmere is the finest ... at no more than 19.5 microns. Cashgora goes up to 25 microns. Mohair measures anywhere from 23 to 40 microns.

It consisted of two hard wood runners, about thirty feet in length, with two mortised and cross-bolsters about ten feet apart, on which the logs were placed, and well chocked. In order to prevent the runners from catching on the skids they were rounded off with an upwards snipe, and this was done at both ends, thus avoiding the necessity of the turning the cat around for the return trip.

Quote: It was astonishing the tremendous loads they could pull out of the bush along the ground - `snigging', that was called. In many places the logs were brought out on what was called a `cat', which was short for catamaran. A catamaran was a big heavy sledge made of bush timber ... The bushmen would build a special road for them - a corduroy road, or `skidded' road, as we used to call it.

Quote:  [Notice on exhibit] CATAMARAN One of the more popular methods of getting logs out of the bush it was usually associated with the skidded road, a small section of which is shown here, and hauled by a team of bullocks consisting of 12 to 16 animals. This particular `Cat' is made of white ti-tree runners. The skidded road is also of white ti-tree or `Kanuka'. Constructed by Mr Reg Poyner, Matakohe

The 'catch' then takes a lamb, passes his hands between its forelegs, seizes its hindlegs below the hock and places it sitting on the docking-board..the 'catch' should hold the lamb in such a way that its head rests against his breast. The 'catch' should be careful so to release the lamb that he falls on all fours.

Quote: No man, even if he were actually in the pen could bring another sheep out on the board after the bell had gone [for smoko etc]. For the last 10 minutes of each run, the men would endeavour to select sheep which would enable them to just beat the gong and get an extra sheep. This was known as `getting the catch.' With the old New Zealand hours of 5.30 to 5.30, the day was broken into 6 `runs', and getting a `catch' each time meant another half a dozen sheep to the day's tally.

It is amusing to watch the tactics of some of the shearers to dodge the Kapara (Cobbler) the last sheep in the pen, which, presumably, is the worst shearing sheep of the lot.

The former aimed at the incorporation of the provincial governments, with a view to their ultimate absorption, and maintained the right of the General Assembly to intermeddle in all provincial affairs. The latter, on the other hand, insisted that the Imperial Parliament had established two independent governments in New Zealand, each for its own sphere, the provinces having exclusive jurisdiction in all provincial matters, and only under the control of the General Assembly on matters of general concern.

Quote: Trading agreements such as our Closer Economic Partnership with Singapore and our Closer Economic Relationship with Australia, can make it easier for our exporters to break into crucial overseas markets. In relation to your criticism of the consultation process and the lack of parliamentary scrutiny that preceded the conclusion of the Singapore CEP, the coalition government went to great lengths to ensure that there was ample opportunity for consultation and debate... The "basic problems" with the Singapore CEP referred to in the editorial have so far proved to be groundless.

Quote: Three years ago a group of leading producers of farmed venison made a bold move. Believing that the word "venison" conjured up something wild, gamy and tough, which weekend hunters might bring down from the hills and give away to friends, they decided to rename their meat... However, cervena was to be more than just a name. It was also to be a trademark that would guarantee quality. In addition, heeding the lesson learnt from kiwifruit growers after they renamed their product, the name cervena would also be registered as an appellation.

'Chaffy' and 'baggy' raised a smile merely, but 'straw walloper' tickled everybody except the witness, who glanced around with an air of pity on the laughing faces of those who were ignorant of the designation of the man who attends to the straw elevator.  Some machines, it appears, boast of two 'straw wallopers', others are content with one'.

Threshing out of the stock required an even larger gang, usually about three more men. ...

The butchers didn't believe that they could be replaced, but when the works reopened it was found that the companies had installed the American chain system, with each worker responsible for only one aspect of the process. The butchers were replaced by the unemployed, who initially made a terrible mess of the carcasses. But in time they became competent process workers, as opposed to the tradesmen who had preceded them.

These consist of lengths of chain, made of 12 gauge galvanised-iron wire, spaced about 3 ft. apart along the fence and fastened to the fence wires by patent fasteners. Barbed wire is used for the top and bottom wires, the barbs keeping the chain droppers in place along the fence wires. The use of the new angle steel fence posts with the chain droppers gives a fence with all the advantages mentioned above, and at the same time one that is much cheaper than a conventional fence.

Notes: R. Gilberd (milling Okaihau, Northland) The old method of tightening the chain securing logs to trucks is called `twitching' or `taking a twitch.' First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is passed through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch.' `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `pitch.'

Quote: Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at.

This use of the term is said to originate from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris during the 19th century, where proctors circulated a cart, or "charrette", to collect final drawings while students frantically put finishing touches on their work.

Charrette is a French word used by architects and urban designers to describe a process that is creative, which operates with community input, but under pressure and with a high degree of focus... If support continues, then the team will proceed to the second stage - the holding of a design "charrette" probably some time in November.

Quote: The word "cheeky" quite obviously refers to the plump part of a person's face, and the word "darkie" in our dictionary alludes to people of profound intellectual depth... Cheeky, of course, is what his rounded face is; little is what his height is; and bugger, as we know, is a word coined by an advertising agency meaning "a serendipitous accident". It doesn't mean at all what is used to mean - and that's official.

Once going, the truck gathers momentum and automatically tips itself. It is then returned again and again by the horses and again and again tipped in a like manner, until the work is completed.

Quote: ... it is no doubt also responsible for the dark coloured varnishes produced from the chip grades. [fn] The terms dust, seeds, chips, nubs, &c., are the names given to certain of the lower kauri gum grades according to the relative sizes of the pieces. From `dust' the size of the fragments increases in the order given, as does also the purity of the grade. Chalk, or `chalky gum,' is a particular grade recovered from swampy country and is characterized by its white or chalky appearance and large water content.

Quote: Crossbred descriptions were mainly light conditioned, good average topmaking wools, though a proportion lacked full length and were affected by 'chiv' and light discoloration, thus restricting the supply of specialty types. Much of the offering was affected by vegetable fault, especially in respect to 'chiv' and moit. Good average topmaking pre-lamb shorn crossbreds predominated in the offering, which, because of seasonal faults of slight discoloration and 'chiv' included rather less good to super wools and specialty types than are usually on hand at this time.

A few handfuls were excellent in quenching one's thirst, and so plentifully did the plant abound that quantities could soon be gathered. ...

Quote: In New Zealand, chutney, is most often made with fruit, including dried fruit such as raisins. It is usually sweeter than a pickle, and is cooked long enough to develop a thick, jammy consistency. There is a fresh chutney which is made of chopped fresh fruit, herbs or coconut and is served as soon as it is ready. Fresh chutney is closer in style to the original chatni, the Indian word from which chutney is derived, than to the savoury jam that we call chutney, which had its origins in Britain.

The civilization that had been going on had been checked, owing in a great degree to the late war. ... The Natives were, however, in a state of retreat from civilization before the wa[r]s, from various causes, such as the loss of power by the old chiefs - a loss that allowed the Natives to fall into a state of political anarchy, because no institutions had been given them in its place. Another cause of decay was, that they had lost the arts of their old life before they had acquired the arts of civilization.

Quote: [Paremoremo prison] Classification Block slowly evolved into a de-classification block. True, all new `Parry' residents were initially sent there for observation and assessment. But `Class' was also the home of prisoners who did not quite fit elsewhere - inmates who needed protection from others, those who could not cope with the stresses of prison life or men deserving punishment that stopped short of incarceration in D Block.

Quote: The classer has the key position in the shed and I always feel that in New Zealand his importance has often been underrated. He has full authority over the shed hands and is in complete control of the wool. In addition he can, if he has the right personality, have a very big influence over the shearers, and contribute very much towards the peaceful efficiency of the whole shearing. Besides these qualities of leadership and authority he is expected to be highly skilled in the classing and preparation of wool for sale. <i>Ibid.</i> 28 The classer stands beside the gong ... and when the clang of the old isc blade rings through the shed, the catching pen doors are flung open ...

Quote: SUCKLING CLOVER (<i>Trifolium dubium</i>) was formerly named <i>T. minus.</i> Alternative common names are yellow suckling clover and little trefoil. it is common in pastures throughout all the sown grass lands and even where no sowing has taken place. Its seeds pass unharmed through sheep, and are therefore scattered wherever sheep can travel.

Unless this stem finds a suitable host plant, e.g.; red clover, it dies, but if such a plant is present the stem twines round it, and sends little suckers through its skin, and commences to draw nutriment from it.

A special NZ application of <i>charter</i>, in that the charter did not constitute the club or give it a higher status but was no more and no less than a liquor licence. Now replaced by the <i>club licence</i> except for some old chartered clubs. Collins notes chartered club in this sense as <i>NZ</i>.

Quote: Clusters are the latest fashion in business development... With Industry New Zealand funding waiting to be claimed, a cluster could also provide a job for an organiser. Or part-time work for more than one person. In that sense, the fad for clusters is a little like the old public service with people paid by the government - which is better than simply getting the dole because the government funding may in turn help to create a self-paying job.

Cardinal Williams presented some ideas as to how we might cluster parishes... From all the discussions that day it seemed those present were in favour of clustering soon and of clustering the Archdiocese as a whole.

The coal-box lobbed about 20 yards away and gently rolled against the other side of the saddle - a dud. P.S. Have often wondered if the Sergeant tip-toed away in case it woke up.

As a name for the numerous wild and half-wild horses of the region it has replaced another Maori colloquialism, `taika'. That name came from `Tiger', the first horse to be seen on the Coast, a piebald stallion given by Tamati Waka Nene to Waka Perohuka of Poverty Bay in exchange for the canoe, Te Toki-a-Tapiri.

When the Otago gold discoveries became known in 1860, a Melbourne coach driver, Charles Cole, chartered a ship and brought his coach and horses to Dunedin in October 1861 and set up the first coach line, Cobb and Co., C.C. Cole and Co., proprietors. The name Cobb was used as a traditional one in respect of the "first" coach line, and also as a means of advertising, for which a licence fee was paid in some instances.

Quote: Cobber.- `Revival' gives a reminder that the much-used `cobber' is a revival of an old word that had a run in the colonies long years ago. The writer gives an opinion that the term came originally from the cockney quarter of London. `Dinkum' was current at least twenty years ago; the war has given it another lease of life.

Quote: When the word is given to start, the shearers go into the `catching-pen' and feel over the sheep, select one, carry it out on to the shearing-floor, and commence shearing. Naturally, the easiest-shorn sheep -- `bare-bellies' and `bare points' -- are selected first. It is amusing to watch the tactics of some of the shearers to dodge the Kapara (Cobbler) the last sheep in the pen, which, presumably, is the worst shearing sheep of the lot.

Quote: The `wool-shed' where all shearing is done has a row of pens (`catching-pens' they are called) in it reaching from one end to the other, each pen holding some 25-30 sheep. Opposite each of these are two shearers, who draw their sheep one by one out of their pen until the pen is exhausted. Naturally each man tries to pick a sheep that looks easy to shear, so the last one is generally a great ugly brute with matted wool and his fleece full of sand. This fellow is invariably nicknamed the `cobbler.'

Quote: <i>Cobbler.</i> The worst sheep in the pen. When two shearers share a catching pen they usually start with the easiest sheep and work until only the roughest sheep are left. The last and usually the roughest sheep of all is the cobbler.

Quote: <i>cobbler</i>: The last sheep left in the catching pen (because it was difficult to shear) is called the `cobbler', a play on `the cobbler's last'. Naturally shearers like to make this their `bell sheep'. It was a simple transfer to use the term `cobbler' or `sandy cobbler' to describe a rough hard sheep at any time. .

Quote:  [The Red Rock Cod], is also known as the `Common Scarpee' and in Napier it is known as the `Cobbler'. Perhaps `Cobbler' would be the best to use for this fish, but it is unfortunately not known under this name outside Napier. The name Red Rock Cod is generally used that it would be very confusing if the name was changed, and under these circumstances the name Red Rock Cod will have to remain.

[110] These small farmers [who have started from next to nothing] are called Cockatoos in Australia by the squatters or sheepfarmers who dislike them for buying up the best bits of land on their runs; and say that, like a cockatoo, the small freeholder alights on good ground, extracts all he can get from it, and then flies away to `fresh fields and pastures new.' ... [111] However, whether the name is just or not, it is a recognized one here; and I have heard a man say in answer to a question about his usual occupation `I'm a Cockatoo.' ... The Cockatoos are `nobody's business' [that is, their interests are looked after by no one in particular].

Quote: Many words in daily use in Otago bear traces of importation from the neighbouring Australian colonies, and none betrays its Australian origin more than that used to denote the agricultural class who are usually styled `cockatoos.' Important as they are, the cockatoos are not so interesting from a literary point of view, as the miners.

Quote: ~ (1) Bird-name. The word is Malay, <i>Kakatua.</i> (O.E.D.') -->(2) A small farmer, called earlier in Tasmania a Cockatooer (q.v.). The name was originally given in contempt (see quotations), but it is now used by farmers themselves. <i>cocky</i> is a common abbreviation. Some people distinguish between a <i>cockatoo</i> and a <i>ground-parrot</i>, the latter being the farmer on a very small scale. Trollope's etymology (see quotation, 1873) will not hold, for it is not true that the cockatoo scratches the ground. After the gold fever <i>circa</i> 1860, the selectors swarmed over the country and ate up the substance of the squatters; hence they were called <i>Cockatoos</i>. The word is also used adjectivally.

Quote: Perhaps the most recurrent and universal of rough games in the early period was <i>Cockfighting</i> (K-78). This was a free-for-all contest in which a smaller boy mounted on the back of a bigger boy and the two endeavored [sic] to dislodge all other riders by pushing or [202] pulling them over. ... Sometimes the game was known as a Piggy-back Contest or as Pulling Off. `One trick of the game was to `buck-jump' your rider, which consisted in jerking your elbows so that the rider was lifted over your head' (Naseby, Otago, 1905).

Quote: We had our games [c1907]. A favourite was `Monkey', where the contestant climbed one of the fir trees along one side of the ground (still there at the present day) and did a grand traverse of as many trees as possible. It was characterized by noise, boasting, cheating and an occasional sprained wrist. There was cockfighting in which each of two players, mounted pick-a-back, tried to resist dislodgement.

Quote: Montana would, in the 1960s, expand its operations to a 120-hectare vineyard at Mangatangi in the northern Waikato and would soon launch onto the market a concoction which even today lives on in the national memory of a generation - Cold Duck, along with Montana Pearl, was made from siebel bybrid grapes with a touch of sherry material thrown in. Drunk like cordial at student balls, these two - and another Montana line, an orange-flavoured concoction called Poulet Poulet - possibly led to more acts of sexual intercourse than any other contributing factor in the New Zealand of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Cold Duck was certainly the most popular of the booze labels that served those grim days when getting legless was the sole purpose of a night out.

Quote: New Zealanders are just as sloppy about their use of the term `college'. Here, a high school may find itself honored with the title of `college'. In America, `college' means only one thing - an institute of higher learning above the high school - the New Zealand `university college'. For this reason confusion often crops up - when someone from Arizona reports the very true fact that [50] `five years of college education are necessary before one can become a high school teacher', he means five years of university work - through the M.A. degree. The New Zealander usually thinks he means one year beyond high school, and therefore thinks of American educational standards as being lower than they are.

He very soon discovers that he really is a `new chum' in the true sense of the word; he cannot crack a stock whip, his first attempt probably causing the lash to come in severe contact with his own face ... in these and many other things he will find himself far from being up to the colonial standard of efficiency, so he must bear the name of new chum with equanimity, till the happy time arrives when he is capable of performing his various duties in true colonial fashion.

Quote: `It looks different to me. You've always got to be the boss. Is that just pakeha, or is it being a man? Let me just be myself. Don't try to make me be like you. Then we'll get along fine. But don't try to colonize me. You do it all the time.' Colonize. A strange word for her; must have learnt it in school. Why the English came out here: to colonize New Zealand. That would be pretty hard for them to take : Maori kids, being told how they were colonized.

Quote: If an unfortunate new chum ventures mildly to protest against some trifling hardships he is at once silenced by being told that it is evident he is not `colonised' yet, and that he must get used to such things. If any particular philologist should read this, he will probably object to the word colonised in place of the more correct but uglier colonialised, but he would find it a vain task to attempt to argue the colonists into the use of any other.

In return, sensitive and valued conservation areas are set aside as Crown reserves. Valley floors tend to remain farmed while higher country is protected.

[quoting 1898 Reeves Long White Cloud 335-336] ... [48] John Sheehan, one of the ablest ... debaters in the opposition, claimed that the most `inoffensive epithet' he could apply to the government [c1875] was that of the `continuous Government'. [NZPD 1875, 19, p. 60] The `Continuous Ministry' label was established by frequent reiteration. Samuel Hodgkinson ... flatly asserted: `this is a continuous Ministry. There may have been a new material put into it, but it is much the same Ministry as an old garment is the same garment though it has been patched from time to time.' [quoting NZPD, 1877, 26, p. 31]

Quote: Now then for the `Coo-ey'. This corresponds to our English Hoy! Halloa! but is infinitely more puzzling - for the Hoy and the Halloa are generally but preludes to an explicit expression in plain English of the wishes of the Hoyer or the Halloer to the Hoyee or Hallowee respectively. Coo-ey however is far more extended in its signification and is often expected to convey that signification in itself. Coo-ey can be heard for a very very long way - the `Coo-' is dwelt on for some time and the `ey' is brought out sharp and quick in high relief as it were from the Coo - and at an unnaturally high pitch. It requires some courage to give vent to a Coo-ey at first; the first attempts are generally abortive, not to say rather doleful and at the same time ludicrous; by and by however as one gains confidence one's Coo-eys are more successful; my own at present is quite unimpeachable though in [46] England nothing would have induced me to give utterance to such a noise on any consideration. The butcher boy is coming up with the meat. He Coo-eys a long way off and by the time he has got up to the house the door is opened to receive the meat and he goes on his way rejoicing ...

This I foolishly gave away for a trifle, (which I am sorry for as several of my friends would have liked to have had it). [fn] The idea for these brass medals to commemorate the voyage of the <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Adventure</i> came from Joseph Banks. Measuring 42mm in diameter they were struck by Matthew Boulton for the Admiralty (39, vol 2, p. xxix) and distributed to native people during the voyage (Plates 109 and 110). Cook left some of these medals in a Maori canoe on the beach at Cascade Cove in Dusky Bay in March 1773 (39, vol 2, p.113). The medal found by Boultbee fifty-three years later is the only one known to have been found in Dusky Bay (Plate 113).

The Cook Strait click beetles have long lost their ability to click, so have to rely on their bark colouring to merge into the tree trunks from which they eat lichen and oozing sap.

Notes: Captain Cook's crest, scurvy grass.  A rare plant, Lepidium oleraceum, with celery-like leaves, used by James Cook as a fresh green to combat scurvy. Loosely used, the term scurvy grass covers a range of brassicaceous herbs in New Zealand, but the specific Lepidium oleraceum, now endangered, was in plentiful supply in the time of Cook's visits.

It was once common, but is now fairly rare partly due to grazing by stock, and perhaps partly to the appetite of the cabbage white butterfly. <i>Ibid.</i> As its common name suggests, the plant was however used by Captain Cook as a remedy for scurvy, a disease caused by lack of vitamin C in the diet.

Homonym Number:

Sense Number:
Definition:Copper Maori seems to have been used by Europeans in the North Island (esp. Northland) for the more usual hangi, umu. with <i>copper</i>. The Maori suffix (variously spelt in early texts) is curious. (1) It is used both with its flexionless Maori pl and its anglicised pl in -s. (2) If it is an aj, the placement after the noun follows Maori grammatical usage: a fuller anglicisation would be <i>Maori copper</i>, occas. used. (3) Williams (p?) states that <i>Maori aj and n `native, belonging to New Zealand' is a comparatively recent use not recorded before 1850, and probably first used by Maoris themselves. Is this an early Maori use of the modern sense of Maori? Or an early Pakeha use? (4) Or is it a use of the sense `normal, usual, ordinary' <i>- kopa Maori</i> being the usual earth-oven, perhaps distinct from the iron tripot etc., (then called in English `copper'), the <i>*kopa Pakeha; </i>

Quote: Coppre [<i>kopa</i>] Mourie, or the Native Ovens are described I rather think in Captain Cookes Voyages. They are done this way. They scratch a hole 8 or 10 inches deep and two Feet in Diameter and then light the Fire in the hole; when the fire is at its best. They cover it all over with Stones The size of Potatoes or what you would put on the roads in England. They are well heated and [when] the fire dies down a wet cloth of Mat is put round the edge. The Potatoes having been scraped with Shells, are laid on the hot stones. A small Calebash of Water is thrown over the stones & Potatoes and fire first taken out, a tremendous steam arises, and a wet mat is laid over all and then covered up with six or seven inches of Earth, left for three quarters of an hour, and then they are beautifully done so you see these Potaotes Pies. The Natives now begin to use Iron pots, known to them by the name of, `Go on Shores,'* from the circumstance of Boats going up and down the Rivers, coming to an Anchor and going on Shore to Cook, but the Natives prefer the Old plan and I think they are right.

Line the bottom and sides with stones as big as a breakfast cup then light a fire over them till they are quite red hot throwing in more loose stones to put on the top. Then take out all the ashes, wrap your meat in green grass put it in the pit, throw the loose stones on top and cover the whole with sods of grass, clay or anything that will keep the steam in, three or four hours will cook your meat to perfection.

Quote: ~ This spelling has been influence by the English word <i>Copper</i>, but it is really a corruption of a Maori word. There is a difference of opinion amongst Maori scholars what this word is. Some say <i>Kapura</i>, a common fire used for cooking, in contradistinction to a `chief's fire,' at which he sat sat, and which would not be allowed to be defiled with food. Others say <i>Kopa</i>. The Maori word <i>Kopa</i> was (1) <i>adj</i> meaning <i>bent</i>, (2)<i> angle</i> or <i>corner</i>, and (3) the native oven, or more strictly the hole scooped out for the oven.

Being nocturnal they are active mainly by night and eat small insects, spiders and similar invertebrates.The Copper Skink does not lay eggs but is a live-bearer.  Usually 3 - 7 in number, the young are born in February - March and are often large at birth, sometimes up to half the adult length.

Notes: Ian Douglas (51 Liverpool St, Wanganui; dougie@xtra.co.nz) says the term used in England 60 years ago was "poss stick" a long wooden stick.  "There was also a 'posser' which was a pole with a sort of vacuum creating hood on the end which was used to dump or dunk the clothes up and down and help shift the dirt." John Mihaljevic (jmjm@ihug.co.nz) writes that a BBC World Service My Century documentary (The Invention that Feed Women) broadcast by Radio NZ has a woman born in the East End of London in 1927 describing washdays (presumably the 1930s) and referring to her mother's use of copper sticks. "This was not just any piece of wood, but a specific tool; she described it as a 'one-handled rolling pin'" Alan Burnett (aged 75) writes (2/10/1999) that when he was a child in Scotland "we always spoke of the copper-stick or SPURKLE which was made by cutting a broom-handle in half! and used for poking the boiling clothes.

These in turn are bred, half-breds to half-breds, for four generations, and a Corriedale is the result.

Couldn't you turn on a counter supper for once?' <i>Ibid.</i> 257 All the hotels had dropped their counter lunches [at the start of the Depression], but tha hit custom so heavily that they had to resurrect a ghost of the old hearty piles; that was only between noon and two o'clock, and you had to nip in quickly, or the sere sandwiches and stale pickles had been whisked out of sight. Cheese was a thing of the past.

Something to fill up on ... or to toss on the bar as counter-lunch. Come to think of it, counter-lunch is <i>le mot juste</i>, stifling as it does all desire for other food.

Quote: COUNTRY QUOTA was a percentage once added to the population of rural electorates to give them what was seen as a fairer balance with urban electorates in general elections. The country quota was first granted in 1881 and was equivalent to one-third of the population added to the actual population of rural constituencies. This was reduced to 18 per cent in 1887 and then increased to 28 per cent in 1889, the figure at which it remained until the country quota was abolished by the Labour Government in 1945.

Quote: The electoral device known as the 'country quota' was first used in New Zealand in 1881 when a 'quota' equivalent to 33 1/3 per cent of the population was added to rural constituencies. In 1887 this was reduced to 18 per cent, but was increased in 1889 to 28 per cent. It remained at this figure until 1945 when it was abolished by the Labour Government. Between 1881 and 1945 the `country quota' was added to the population of rural electorates which, for the purposes of the Electoral Act, meant population other than that contained in a city or borough of over 2,000 inhabitants, or in any area within 5 miles of the chief post offices in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, or Dunedin.

Within hours a raft of MPs were calling for a change at the top - something which became overheated and almost spooked the inner circle of coupsters who were beginning to wonder if they were managing one coup or two.

Quote: BARRACOUTA (MANGA) <i>Leionura atun dentatus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) INCREDIBLE as it may seem these fish, with their well-armed jaws of sharp fang-like teeth, were usually caught on a slightly curved stick about four feet in length. Fastened to this stick was a piece of stout fishing line about three to four feet in length, carrying a piece of red-coloured wood - usually cedar - about five to six inches in length. A bent nail was secured to this piece of wood in the form of a hook but no bait was used. When a school of Barracouta was found the Couta stick, or paw, was brought out ready for fishing. From the cockpit of the launch the piece of wood with the nail was violently swirled with a circular motion in and out of the water, causing a disturbance of the water in a good imitation of a number of Sprats, Pilchards or other small fish jumping in and out of the sea. The Barracouta would swim for such a place. Seeing the piece of red wood moving rapidly through the water they would take it for a fish, snap at it or even jump out of the water for the lure and were caught by the crude iron hook. As the fish was hooked during the time the paw was being drawn through the water the fisherman would swing the fish over his head above the boat or launch and when the caught fish was midway in the air, more or less above the cockpit, would expertly give the stick a dexterous smart twist. As there was no barb on the hook the fish was released and fell into the cockpit.

Quote:  [<i>Ibid</i> 311] Should there be any Barracouta about the... Couta sticks were then set to work to paw the water and attract Barracouta to the spot. [<i>I bid.</i>314] The Maori also knew he could catch Barracouta without bait and he, too, used a short piece of stick and line with a baitless hook and leaned over his canoe and threshed the water to and fro, which is known as `Kaihau manga!' When the European fisherman called his fishing outfit [315] `paw', the Maori uses the term `pa'. This fish was a great favourite with them and was caught in large numbers. On returning to the shore, the women cleaned the fish and then hung them up on racks to dry in the sun. Old Maoris of Opotiki told me they used a chip of Tawhai (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>), which is dark red, in the making of a pa (paw).

The old rule stated that after January 2000, a competitor ahall not engage any person in any capacity who has sailed on another competitor's yacht. It now reads "from March 2 this year a person contracted, employed, paid or otherwise engaged by a competitor, may not be engaged by another competitor." The change was quickly dubbed the "Coutts Clause" and means Coutts, one of the most effective America's Cup skippers in history, is probably out of the preparation for the 2007 challenge in Valencia.

Quote: In the time that we spent on the farm with Peter Fisher we reached the conclusion that he is applying in his approach to his job that mixture of qualities which can best be summed up in two words, 'good cowmanship.' And as we have said on many occasions before - good cowmanship - the natural capacity to get the best from each individual member of the herd - is the highest common factor in successful dairy farming.

Quote: We went down a spur for two miles that was very soft from the late rain, and full of waterholes, called crab-holes. These holes were formed by the large snowgrass tussocks being burnt out roots and all, leaving a hole, or by the uprooting of trees, where the hole was very large ... In some places these holes made by(?) cattle mustering a most hazardous undertaking. In Mr Alex Garvie's report in 1858 he refers to `podge holes,' presumably a variety of `crab-holes.'

Quote: Like a child's cradle, [a miner's cradle] had two rockers fastened to its base, and it was rocked rather more violently. But internally the resemblance ended. It was, broadly speaking, an open box with the sides sloping inwards towards the base, and the bottom board extended about a foot beyond the end; while the end board, which formed one of the sides, did not reach to the bottom, but left an aperture. The box was fitted on top with an iron hopper punched full of quarter-inch holes and with sides about three inches high. It was into this hopper that the gold-bearing gravel was thrown, a shovelful at a time.

Quote: It took two men to work the cradle satisfactorily - one to shovel and one to rock it violently by means of a handle that was fastened up the back end of the contraption, and at the same time to dash water on to it by means of a dipper fastened to a stick. The cradle was always placed, of course, at the water's edge, and the stones that did not fall through the hopper were tipped out the front end, which was left without any retaining side. The material which was washed through the holes, and which contained the gold, fell straight down on to a sloping wooden table covered with a coarse piece of matting on which the gold was saved. The table was fitted firmly against the back and sides of the box, but stopped short about an inch from the front end to allow the tailings and what gold was not saved to fall on to another table - this one fitting firmly to the front end and the sides, and sloping dowm towards the back end. From there the tailings fell on to the back end of the bottom board, which was generally covered with coconut matting to catch any gold that might have gone all the distance, and followed along the bottom and out over the lip. By this means the wash had to travel a surprisingly long distance, and was also shaken from side to side of the cradle, so that there little chance if it was worked properly of losing any gold.

This uncommon fish has several names, all of which relate to its manner of producing electric shocks, some of which are Numb-fish, Crampfish and Electric Skate. These vernacular names are given by fishermen on account of the fish benumbing or paralysing the person who unwittingly grasps one with his hands. The last name is from the somewhat similar shape to that of a skate or ray, ray being another common term for skates and also the scientific family name.

Quote: Perhaps the most intriguing game of this nature [sc. tormenting insects or animals] is `Spang Weazling'. This game was played at Denniston in 1930-35. A crawley was placed on the end of a stick the middle section of which lay balanced over a stone. Before the crawley could crawl off the stick a stone had to be thrown onto the other end of the stick so as to catapult the crawley off the stick and over the cliff. A variation of the same game was being played at Denniston when I visited there in 1949. It was called alternatively `Hit the Crawley' or `Strike the Crayfish'. In this version the other end of the stick was hit with a batting stick (as in Tip Cat) and when the crawley was catapultedinto the air it was hit again with the bat.

Quote: The miners always carried their food (crib) to work in a specially designed tin box called a crib tin, together with an enamelled tea billy equipped with a drinking mug. The crib tin was necessary in the damp conditionsm because the mine was overrun with rats as big as bulldogs. The miners looked for a dry spot in a worked-out section of tunnel in which to leave their gear. This was known as the `crib cuddy'.

Quote: In New Zealand there are two classes of men that are rarely found connected with Agriculture in England, viz:- Contractors and croppers. ... The contractors undertake to do the ploughing, harrowing, sowing and other farm operations at a given price per acre ... The croppers are a class of men who pay a price per acre for the privilege of taking off a crop of corn after the land had been fed a couple of years in clover or grass. ... [6] [Origin of contractors and croppers is: `the great want of the Colony is and has been <i>men</i> not money'; and `the large holdings and the inability of the landowner to work all his land himself']

Quote: The term driving generally referred to tunnelling in any direction but in some circumstances, where reefs were present, it meant tunnelling along the line of the reef or parallel to it. The term drifting was used more specifically for driving on a reef, while the term crosscutting referred to tunnelling across the reef up to an angle of say forty-five degrees; however it was common to talk of `driving a crosscut'. <i>Ibid.</i> 317 <i>Crosscut</i>: A tunnel cutting across the reef system. As the shafts were sunk to new levels a main crosscut was put out from the shaft chamber on each level to cut the reefs approximately at right-angles, after which driving in both directions usually started on the first reef, while crosscutting continued until the farthest reef was opened up. It was usually necessary to make a [318] connection with the level above, near the end of the crosscut, for ventilation.

Quote: Crown entities are not departments or ministries, like the Department of Internal Affairs or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Neither are they state-owned enterprises, like New Zealand Post. The term crown entity has been applied like a mop to most of the other bodies which the crown has set up over the years to carry out little bits of its business. There are about 160 of them... We've divided them into five categories... Crown agents... Independent, quasi-judicial bodies (e.g. the Police Complaints Authority or the Environmental Risk Management Authority)..Trusts (e.g. Road Safety Trust).. Companies (e.g. Radio New Zealand).. Other organisations (e.g. schools).

The first is very small and in a dry season merely drips from the rocks, and is called `Crying Jenny.' The second, which tumbles down from the mountains impetuously and with great noise, is `Roaring Meg.' The third, being a sluggish stream, has received, by popular assent, the designation of `Gentle Annie.'

Quote: But the most interesting of all the team games was a small group game variously known as <i>Cunning Joe</i> (K-6), Cunny, Conjure, Conjo, Cunny Joe, and Cronje. In this game the cat [a thin 6-inch stick with pointed ends] was sometimes called the Cunning Joe stick (Waikouaiti, Otago, 1900) or the kip (Dunedin, 1895). It was a game for four players. Two rings were marked on the ground a short distance from each other with a square drawn in the middle of each. A boy armed with a short stick stood at each ring, a bowler behind him. One of the bowlers tossed a short piece of wood at the ring opposite. The striker hit it as hard as he could, then both boys ran as in cricket.

Quote: The most pervasive customary right was customary title, which, though unique, almost equated to ownership. It was territorial and the hapu could not have existed without the full use of the land in question. To prove a customary title, a hapu had to show it was in exclusive occupation of the land prior to sovereignty passing and that it had continued to follow customary activities on it ever since.

Quote: What is customary title? Much like an ordinary title to land, customary title confers rights to the holder. These could include the right to use the land for farming or living on. However, customary title arises where the Maori holds land in accordance with tikanga Maori or Maori custom. It is held communally (as opposed to owned) and cannot be alienated (sold or mortgaged) to anyone but the crown.

Several men would hold the cattle together in a bend of a boggy creek or a corner of a paddock while the [136] `cutter-out' rode through them, and after spotting the beast that he wanted, would follow it out to the edge of the mob, when the holder would open out and allow both beast and cutter-out to pass through... A second's false timing, and the cutter-out's manoeuvre was ruined. I have had some nice things said about my ancestors by the cutter-out when things do not eventuate as they should have done.

Quote: The `cutting-up' of a whale, <i>secundum artem</i>, is a process which requires great proficiency, like that of the skilful dissector, who separates the cutis, and with it at once all fat and cellular tissue, from the subjacent muscles. In the whale the blubber is to be regarded as the cutis, in the cellular structure of which the oily matter has been deposited. Shortly after the death of the fish the epidermis comes off in large pieces, looking like oiled and dried satin.
