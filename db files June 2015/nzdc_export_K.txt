Quote: New Zealanders are outdoors people and part of many Kiwis' upbringing includes going fishing, for kahawai off the beach, rocks or local wharf. Grandparents and even parents remember giant schools of kahawai churning up the sea within a stone's throw of the shore. That abundance and the fish's fighting qualities made the kahawai the "people's fish".

This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai.

Quote: When in a hurry, or feeling orthographically tired, he [the southerner] calls the big manuka `kaikatoa.' A southern Maori once said to me:- `We did not pronounce the word manuka like some northerners who throw the accent forward and say `man-u-ka,' nor like the bushmen, who say `m'nooka,' but about halfway between these two pronouncing each part clearly as mah-nook-a.' Unless my hearing deceives me this throws the emphasis on the central syllable while leaving the first syllable clearly pronounced. It is a remarkable fact that while the manuka is so common its name is so seldom used in the composition of place-names.

Quote: Kate Mitchell raises an fascinating point about the phrase "the big kahuna"... Where it gets interesting, though, is finding references to similar words beginning with t- instead of k-, the sort of consonant transliteration not uncommon in Polynesian languages... Throughout the eastern Pacific the words tahunga and tahuna crop up for people with special powers such as priests and sorcerers. It doesn't take much imagination to see a relationship with our own Maori tohunga, the word for a priest or specially skilled person.

Most prized was the <I>kahurangi</I> stone, bright green, translucent, hard and clear; the<I> inanga</I> variety perhaps comes next, with its white milky-veined appearance, [389] followed by the <i>kawakawa</i>, dark olive-green, dull and opaque. ... <i>Tangiwai</i> (`tear drop'), <i>bowenite</i>, a softer stone of a clear pale green, with the appearance of drops of water in the texture, was less esteemed, though more beautiful in the European eyes, whilst <i>kahotea</i>, green, spotted or streaked with black, was an inferior type, and was used for small chisels, and for objects of subordinate interest.
