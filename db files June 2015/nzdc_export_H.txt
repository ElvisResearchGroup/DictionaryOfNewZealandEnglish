 Quote:  Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was 

intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement.  Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholded

without warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (i.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered. ... One H.P.R. could be taken out for each property and it was only businesslike that each runholder should use this right to secure 250 acres around his homestead against purchase by an outsider. An H.P.R. was initially intended to cover the owner's or manager's home, but, in the case of runs of over 5,000 acres, could be extended to cover an outstation.

 Quote:  The term `hack' as understood in this country is not at all to be conflicted with the same term as applied elsewhere to horse racing under that category. A hack in New Zealand is a horse that has not won a certain amount of moneys [sic], and so it is quite possible for the Derby favorite of the year, or the New Zealand Cup favorite to be a hack.

gesturing, eye-glaring, and cries demoniac, the savagest-looking of which may be in pure fun and

intended as a hearty welcome. Both vowels must be short; h&amacr.ka and hak&amacr. differ altogether in meaning: there is no word h&amacr.k&amacr..

(q.v.) The host group would make large personal sacrifices in order to feed visitors, and such sacrifice increased the sense of sharing both among hosts and between hosts and guests. Hakari now refers to the feast itself.

 Quote:  There is much confusion in the common names applied to New Zealand fishes, and the application of the name `Hake' to several distinct species of our fishes, is a good example of that confusion. in Blenheim, Nelson, Picton and Wellington, a very  different fish, scientifically known as <i>Rexea solandri</i>, and closely related to the Barracouta, with obviously no affinities to the Cod family, is called `Hake' or `Southern Kingfish'. The name Hake applied to this fish is entirely wrong, as it belongs to the Snake Mackerel family, the <i>Gempylidae. </i>

<i>ibid.</i> 154 SOUTHERN KiNGFiSH <i>Rexea solandri</i> (Cuv. & Val.) ... The Southern Kingfish is closely related to the Barracouta, and is known in the North island as the `hake' but this name is more accurately applied to a very different fish, <i>Merlangius australis</i>, which belongs to the true Cod family. <i>ibid.</i> 155 [Southern Kingfish, <i>Rexea Solandri</i>] is found also in southern Australian waters. in Sydney it is sold as `hake'. it is also known as `Hake' in Auckland and sometimes sold as `lemon-fish'. <i>ibid.</i> 170 Southern Kingfish Rexea solandri Hake

 Quote:  ROCK COD or SOUTHERN HAKE <i>Lotella rhacinus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) Up to 1891 this fish was universally known to scientists and fishermen  as Hake, then for some unknown reason E. R. Waite (<i>Records of the Canterbury Museum</i>, Vol. 1, No. 3) transferred the name Hake to <i>Merluccius gayi</i>, with Whiting as a second alternative common name. ... The most common name among Otago fishermen was Rock Cod, because this fish favours a rocky habitat.

 Quote:  The Cloudy Bay cod (<i>Lotella rhacinus</i>), also known as rock cod and southern hake, is rather more brown and lacks the dark blotch by the pectoral fin. <i>ibid.</i> 1/898 HAKE is a name applied to several quite different marine fish in  different parts of the country. The whiting or haddock, <i>Merluccius  australis</i>, is a true hake, very similar to the North Sea species; it is, actually, often called English hake. it occurs in fairly deep  water south of Cook Strait. The southern kingfish, <i>Jordanidia  solandri</i>, is also known as hake: it is closely related and similar to the barracouta, and found throughout New Zealand. The Cloudy Bay cod, <i>Lotella rhacinus</i>, is sometimes known as southern hake.(see also Kingfish.)

Mutton-birders who have heard the strange sound of its passing over the islands at night speak of the ha-ka-wai bird. A swish of wings close overhead, a sound like the rattle of chains when a boat lets the anchor down, again the sound of wingbeats and the cry floating earthward from the heavens,  Ha-ka-wai! Ha-ka-wai! in a drawn-out singsong with accent on the first and last syllables.

screaming its `Haku-ai, haku-ai, Ooh!' and then a hair-raising swoosh of great wings ... This bird, called the `hakuai' from its call, is spoken of as a spirit. ... The mystery of the  hakuai may be dispelled by assuming it to be ... the  frigate-bird (Fregata aquila).

The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull,  half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and 

two-and-a-buck. in the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

`perishing like rotten sheep,' these people often say; thus at Kurreroo or Molineux, where there are now half-a-dozen natives, they say that formerly, and at no remote period, about two generations previous to the present, there were above a thousand; and in many other places within the last sixteen years, which is about the extent of the experience of the older beachers, there has been, in many places, a corresponding diminution of numbers. if this is an unexaggerated statement, it is a very distressing one to reflect on. Since Dr. -- visited this settlement, one of the residents, Mr. --, an educated man, has opened a school for half-bred or any other children, and the progress which the children have already made is very encouraging.

The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull,  half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and  two-and-a-buck. in the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull,  half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and  two-and-a-buck. in the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only  two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

 Quote:  A jet boat is a standard boat fitted with a car engine to drive a sophisticated pump or "jet unit". This draws water in through an intake in the bottom of the hull and forces it out at high pressure, jet-like, through a nozzle in the rear. Unlike a conventional boat, the jet boat has neither propellor or rudder. instead, it is pushed along, and steered, simply by the thrust of the jet stream

 Quote:  The Pakeha was much too valuable an animal in those days to be killed and eaten; that game did not pay at all. Cannibal feasts did come off now and again on the sly, but the Pakeha was too dear a morsel, and moreover, was far too salt to be put into a Hangi (native oven) for epicurean Maories. <i>ibid.</i> Bk2/6/107 ... the steam was just arising from their hangis as these were being uncovered, and we were all soon served, each with a little freshly-plaited flax-leaf basket filled with most deliciously cooked kumeras, potatoes and peppies.

 Quote:  in our ranks was a very hard-headed gentleman by the name of Jensen who, on arriving at the pub, breasted up to the bar and ordered a `hangman's blood'. The barman confessed total ignorance of just what this drink might comprise. He was told to produce a beer handle, which 

he did, and was then ordered to go along [17] the entire length of the bar, putting in one nip of whatever spirits were on display. Now at that time spirits were very hard to come by, but Paul Rabone, the proprietor of the Mangatara Hotel, seemed to have an inexhaustible supply. Doing as he was bid the barman proceeded from one end to the other, putting in such things as scotch, gin, bacardi, rum, creme de menthe, and so on. He finally returned to the prospective quaffer of this incredible beverage with the beer mug about quarter-full of a purplish looking liquid. `Now,' said Jensen, `Fill it up with beer.'

 Quote:  Hansard takes its name from the Hansard family, which ran one of the many private-sector companies producing reports on House of Commons debates in the early  [60] 19th century. At the time, no official record was kept of what was said in debates, only of decisions made. Where the Hansards made their name was by producing their reports more quickly than their competitors did.

After leaving Waihao, which was nearly three miles long, we passed several small `hapua' similar to it.

 Quote:  in the early eighteen-nineties digesters were installed for `boiling down' the offals. ... This was essentially a stewing process which took four to six hours' cooking, and separated the fat by partial breakdown of the animal tissues. The residue, or `ashmegandy', was dried in a machine for fertiliser material, as was the blood.

A hatch tent consists of a large, light tarpaulin which is

lashed down round the hatch coaming while its centre is

held up by a wire strung fore-and-aft across the hold. it

provides effective temporary cover for an open hold, saving the time and labour required to replace the more cumbersome permanent hatch covers.

 Quote:  He was what is termed in mining phraseology, a `hatter', - meaning one who works by himself. ... Alone and unaided he scooped the wash-dirt into his cradle, which he vigorously rocked with his left hand, whilst with the right he ladled water from the river into the `hopper' or seive [sic]. ... He cast aside the `dipper', and hastened towards the eddy.

 Quote:  Hatter: Whatever the origin of the phrase, `as mad as a hatter' can have been, i have often unsuccessfully endeavoured to discover. But doubtless it is from this phrase that the name of hatter has come to be applied in mining parlance, to one who works alone or without a mate. There are always a few of these unsocial miners about every digging, and their solitariness arises from every imaginable cause. Frequently they are misanthropes, sometimes placid contented creatures, who, so long as they can make a living by `fossicking' about, are happy. / [139]. My host was a hatter and he always kept a spare stretcher for any chance passer-by.

 Quote:  HATTER: a solitary, a digger who works alone. The derivation of this New Zealand expression is obscure. Archdeacon Harper described the hatters as `men who live and work by themselves, often old sailors and much travelled men, content with the solitude of well-kept huts, a few books, hard work, their dog as companion, perhaps some poultry, and a weekly visit on Saturdays to the townships to sell their gold and see friends. Whence the term `hatter' i have never discovered; maybe because such solitaries are regarded as `mad as a hatter'. Another possibility is suggested by the remark that the hatter `kept his whole world under his hat'.

 Quote:  Hatter. One who works and camps by himself. Originally a miner's expression, no doubt from the saying of a man without relations that he had `all his family under his hat'. Archdeacon  Harper derived the word from `mad as a hatter' (Letters, p. 143). The word is in 

general use on stations. H.'s billy, tent, etc., one just large enough for one man. ([1898 Morris

 Quote:  At Macfarlane's the men saddled fresh horses and rode in some cattle which we had a great bother to yard, as everything was new ... The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiring branding, and after hauling them up to a corner post, leg-roped and threw them on [44] their side, placing a long lever on their neck and under the lowest rail so that they would not move much ... When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.

 Quote:  in the furrow method of irrigation small furrows or corrugations are made in the direction of the slope and connected with a head-ditch supplying water .. Water is taken from the head-ditch, which follows approximately the contour of the surface, into the distributing-furrows, which may be parallel with the ditch or diverge from it. in turning the water from the head-ditch into the furrows the common practice in Central Otago is to make openings in the lower bank with a shovel.

 Quote:  ~ (1) People do not as a rule say (e.g.) `fifty cattle'  but `fifty h. of cattle'. Up country people usually confine this idiom to cattle and sometimes horses. But i see to-day in `The Press' (June 27, 1933)  the editor speaks of a decrease of so many h. of sheep disclosed by this year's sheep return. (C.) (2) A dog goes round to the far side of  a mob of sheep and stops them. This is called heading. Hence  heading dog, one whose work this is. if he does it neatly he makes a good h See also sheep dog. 3. The owner would say, `i can head with him'.(C; [1874 Kennaway Crusts],p. 45)

 Quote:  Heading. in the long head the competitor stands with his dog in a ring (1 chain in diameter) facing a hillside near the top of which three sheep are set loose.  When time is called the dog is dispatched, either on a left-hand or a right-hand cast, up the hill for some 800 yards to a point behind the sheep. On command the dog `lifts' the sheep and, keeping them together, `pulls' them in a direct line back to his master in the ring. To allow the dog to show complete control over the  sheep, the run ends with a `hold in the ring'. This involves stopping the sheep in the ring and 

holding them there. The first stages of the short head are much the same, but over half the distance, 400 yards. At the point where the sheep reach the shepherd, man and dog must drive them ahead down a `drive' which is 60 yards long and 1 chain wide and defined by short poles, to a set of hurdles which are 9 ft apart and parallel with the line of the drive. The sheep are driven between the hurdles and then down a second drive, similar to the first, to the pen or yard, which is 6 ft square. After opening one side, the competitor must stand by the pen gate until the sheep are yarded. The dog must do virtually all the work and his master's right of movement and intervention are strictly limited.

heath  [fn <i>Leucopogon fraseri</i>.], and others too numerous to mention.

 Quote:  Fortunately there were many shrubs of <i>Dracophyllum longifolium. </i> growing in this locality, which even in their green state burn freely, and which enable the traveller in those regions, so much exposed to rain, to light a fire with comparative ease. This plant has needle-shaped leaves, generally of a brownsh tint,and small bell-shaped white flowers. it [115] is generally called a native heath by the Europeans. As some of the bushes grow to a height of ten feet with thick branches, it offers wood enough to keep up a cheerful fire.

But just when Beltway Wellington was beginning to despair of finding any remaining pockets of good, old-fashioned abusable power and influence, some wit coined the term "Helengrad"... <i>ibid.</i> 21 No old hand in Wellington will argue that "Helengrad" is just a catchy insult.

Well, Mr Anderson said, i could never work it out why they were called Henrys - that's what us diggers called them, little Henrys. D'you know, i've always meant to ask somebody why they were called that name.  And it was on the tip of Dave's tongue to explain, but he thought no. Because he'd have to explain why the i's weren't J's, and --[note 271:] ... His explanation of `little Henry' would have been based on i.N.R.i., Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, from Lat. iesus Nazarenus, Rex iudaeorum.

 Quote:  A cow with `a good test', that is, milk rich in butterfat, may be more valuable than another cow that gives more milk. About 1910 the practice rose of smpling milk from all the cows in a herd individually and testing the milk for its fat content. This process is called herd-testing. ... it is still not decided whether the word is hyphenated or not. i find it without a hyphen in a publication of the Department of Agriculture in 1950,  with a hyphen in a textbook of dairying in 1955. Pronunciation is with one stress, on herd. <i>ibid.</i> 149 in New Zealand, everyone uses

the term herd-testing, not  milk-testing, because everyone thinks of the dairy industry from a producer's, not a consumer's, point of view.

 Quote:  Jennifer Green writes that in the 1960s "hiff" was often used when discarding an unwanted item. She even knew of a very large cupboard called The Hiffin, where one hiffed anything that had no other obvious lodging-place. So the magic word "hiff" is not only a South island colloquial verb after all.

Some are put off by the "hisser" mentality, which is apparently still alive in some clubs. Hissers sprint from point to point, seeing nothing. At the hut they bore everyone senseless with their boasts about record times.

 Quote:  Visitors to Wellington comment on the brisk pace of the pedestrians, and Wellington trampers  have achieved a certain notoriety for the speed with which some of them travel in the hills. it is not surprising,  therefore, that its hillmen and hillwomen should hiss along, that hissers and little hissers should flourish, and that little hisser should sometimes be used as a term of approbation - `stew a  hisser', `a real hisser of a day'. The Tramper first gives to hiss in 1934, and hisser with reference to a stew appears on 1940, but to a person not until 1943, though it must have been so used long before.

 Quote:  The back country of New Zealand contains a heritage of about 1400 huts that is unequalled anywhere in the world. 



These huts were built for the following reasons: 

wild animal control (~750) 

sheep mustering (~500) 

recreation (~150) 

a range of other purposes including prospecting, scientific studies and castaway sustenance. 

Others began life as schools and homes and later became huts. These huts have heritage value as the only physical remnant of these activities. ...

DOC is identifying a representative selection of key historic huts that can be managed long term to conserve this heritage and allow its appreciation. it is intended to have interpretation signs provided for each historic hut.

The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. in the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.

 Quote:  The Golden Kiwi was established partly to prevent money being sent out of New Zealand for tickets in Tatt's, a Tasmanian lottery with a name abbreviated from Tattersall's and quite unconnected with the English cant word tatts `dice'. it was illegal to sell tickets in Tatt's in New Zealand but many barbers' shops displayed a notice, `We communicate with Hobart', which was

universally understood.... it was clear that in the context of a barber's shop window the notice meant `we sell tickets in Tatt's', but legally a man can announce that he writes to Tasmania. Newspapers might report the good fortune of winners but the illegal source of the winnings would not be specified. The money came from `an overseas consultation'.

sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram  lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until  cutting the first two teeth. it is then called a two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a  four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an  eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. it is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy

 Quote:  A chance glimpse of The Concise Oxford Dictionary has you wondering. it says: "ice-cream formerly sold esp. by italian street vendors." The Concise's bigger sibling, The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary, is even worse: "A kind of cheap ice-cream sold by street vendors." These English lexicographers would find nothing cheap or italian about the best ice-cream, in the world sold at any Kiwi dairy.

 Quote:  Hokonui sheep are out of the same hills [as Hokonui whisky] and although not illegal, are certainly a curiosity. A fairly original form of Merino, they've run wild for well over a century and have developed, or reverted to, quite a few distinct characteristics. There's the varying shades of black, brown and grey with a wee dash of white on the forehead and a white tip on the tail...'They're just different,' he says. 'Things like positioning of bones and teeth, everything from the traditional farm animal breeding world, you can forget about when it comes to Hokonuis. They're as tough as old boots and interesting in their grazing habits. They prefer rough feed and will eat heads and thistles before they touch the clover.'..interested though he is, there's no way Peter will reduce the Coopworth flock in concession to the Hokonuis.

 Quote:  The first record of the feral Hokonuis was in 1863, a flock of about 200 animals, so they have had 150 years to adapt. The Hokonuis' ancestors are believed to be smooth-skinned Saxony Merinos .. When and how Hokonuis came to be here is unlikely to be proven.

Baker identified the Hokitika version as based on a method of counting `whereby the person who calls a certain number in a sequence pays a specified sum into the jackpot'. Glenn Johnston defines the Hokonui version as a drinking game that combines

elements of chance with the ability to hold your liquor and follow a few simple rules - though the deviousness of the caller can also influence proceedings. The aims are simple: to liven things up, get a bit of alcohol consumed quickly and sort the stayers from the pikers.

 Quote:  in the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (in more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

 Quote:  Of the Help-He games, Kick the Tin, is the most widely known. A tin is placed in the centre of a circle. One He is in charge of the tin. He can only tag the other players when his tin is in the centre of the circle. Any players he catches must stay in the circle. Any non-caught player can help and free the other caught players by running through the circle and kicking the tin out of it. Other names for this game are: Kick the Boot (Gisborne [18]90), Knock the Block or Homaiacky (Nelson [18]95), Kick the football or Piacky (Mangatainoka).

 Quote:  in a few tagging games the players joined hands with the He when they were caught and helped him catch the other players. These games were known as  The Bellahonie (E-21) (Wellington, 1910), Kick Post One (Hampden, Otago, 1880), and Ballyhooley (Wellington, 1920). More popular were those games in which the players helped one another to fight the He, and of these the most widespread was the game known as  Kick the Tin (e-3), Kick the Boot, Kick the Block, or Homiacky.  in this game the He was put on guard of a jam tin placed inside a small circle marked on the ground. [Other players hid: those He could see he named and tapped the tin three times and `captured': other hiders waited till they had chance to kick tin out of circle: then all were free again.]

The shell is the 16th part of an inch in thickness. A hole is drilled in the end of it, and the egg must have been considered of great value by the natives, as it was found deposited at the head of a skeleton, with a number of very large poenamu axes. Mr. Fyfe, we understand, is going to send them home to the British Museum.

 Quote:  The word Home on most New Zealanders' lips is no more than a synonym for the United Kingdom; it does not mean `dear old England', or `my beloved birthplace,' or `my real country'; it does not even mean what the United Kingdom means to all irish irishmen. it simply means the 

United Kingdom, and is used without emotion, as a word that has been handed down from father to son, and mother to daughter. it is part of the real New Zealand language, a genuine piece of Antipodean slang. And, like all slang, it has its significance.

Some ass has said that it is a delegation of good-will to lay the position of the poor Antipodean dairy-man before his relative and talk to him of the `Empire' and `loyalty'!

The generation for which the New Zealand Herald catered in leading articles had almost passed away. Your lectures throughout New Zealand had set the best minds among the pakeha at work. With that generation also had largely passed the pakeha who was wedded to the idea of England being `Home'. The native born New Zealand pakeha is looking nearer to his native heath for objects of study, literary effort and missionary care.

There was nothing glamorous about the Home Guard... it was nearly a year after war was declared that the War Cabinet finally laid plans for the formation of a volunteer Home Guard, to comprise men who were too old or to young to serve overseas, or who were being kept at home in essential occupations... The urgency and seriousness of the war eventually forced Home Guard units to be set up in almost every settlement and town in the country... The Home Guard in New Zealand eventually numbered 12,000 in its ranks.

The definition of "dwellinghouse" is.. .intended to encompass the variety of places in which people can live, including caravans, mobile homes and other structures. it focuses on the use to which a building is put, and is therefore not intended to include buildings or parts of buildings that have some other primary purpose, such as a commercial buildings or hospitals... 17A.. 'Dwellinghouse' means (a) a building or other structure, or part of a building or other structure, that is used by the occupant principally as a residence; or (b) A mobile home, caravan, or houseboat, that is used by the occupant principally as a residence; "Home invasion", when used in the expression 'the offence involved home invasion'.. means that the person who committed the offence did so... (a) While breaking and entering, or otherwise unlawfully entering, an occupied dwellinghouse; or (b) While in an occupied dwellinghouse, after having broken and entered, or otherwise unlawfully entered, the dwellinghouse; or (c) While breaking out of an occupied dwellinghouse; or (d) While otherwise unlawfully in an occupied dwellinghouse

 Quote:  The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

 Quote:  it is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, i only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings.

That is, `My town house is a townhouse', correctly distinguishes, on the page, and will be distinguished in speech; tow stresses for the one, and one stress (TOWNhouse) for the other. There is as well a question of nuance to be noticed. A 

townhouse is emphatically upmarket from a home unit.

However, in New Zealand the phrase has a more depressing definition. "Home alone" is synonymous with the neglect of children for their welfare or the foolhardy belief "nothing can go wrong" even if mum and dad are just popping to the shops for 15 minutes....



The home-alone law has been accused of hurting children because fining parents meant there would be less money for the family.

 Quote:  The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

 Quote:  Homestead. in the old days the owner's residence, but only if it was some distance from the rest of the station buildings (see big house). when the Goverment began cutting up the runs in the 'nineties, they or their surveyors adopted the word to signify what had been formerly called the station, and the new settlers followed them, so that the new sense of the word is now widely used. Butler and Sir F. Weld also use it in the modern sense, but in writing for Englishmen. (C.R.)

 Quote:  it was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.  <i>ibid.</i> 275 The richest claim was always a `homeward-bounder'. A Nelson digger recalled how at work his mates talked of `trips to Europe, going back for a week, and astonishing the Natives generally'. <i>ibid.</i> 329 J. F. Byrne & Co. showed off their wares by the light of six kerosene chandeliers and advertised, THE REAL HOMEWARD BOUNDER!/An ounce to the Dish can be Saved/ BY BUYiNG YOUR/CLOTHiNG AND BOOTS AT THE CORiNTHiAN HALL/ NEW RUSH NEW RUSH /Peg out your claims at the Corinthian Hall if you want to strike a good lead/Dead on the gutter/ BUY YOUR CLOTHiNG AND BOOTS AN THE CORiNTHiAN HALL/

The way it works, on certain accounts, is that for every day the account is improperly overdrawn - i.e. if you haven't previously arranged an overdraft facility - the first two transactions that day each attract a $15 penalty. ... "Fundamentally, " Shaw points out, "there's no reason for a customer to incur an honour fee. An overdraft facility costs you less a year [$28] than two honour fees."

 Quote:  A Tour in Australia and New Zealand 55 Concentration of grazing carries with it other important effects - the benefits of what Bruce Levy has so appropriately termed 'hoof cultivation.' in New Zealand the soil dries so rapidly after rain that the 'hoof' seldom does harm and most frequently only does good - provided of course that a period of rest follows a period of excessive 'cultivation.' The combined application of 'hoof cultivation' and judicious feeding out is a method definitely employed for grass land improvement in New Zealand.

 Quote:  `There are several specimens of bush slang transplanted from the Maori language. `Hoot' is a very frequent synonym for money or wage. i have heard a shearer at the Pastoralist Union office in Sydney when he sought to ascertain the scale of remuneration, enquire of the gilt-edged clerk behind the barrier, `What's the hoot, mate?' The Maori equivalent for money is utu, pronounced by the Ngapuhi and other northern tribes with the last syllable clipped, and the word is very largely used by the kauri-gum diggers and station hands in the North island. The original  meaning of first settled in New Zealand, they found that the savage inhabitants had no conception of any recompense except the grim recompense of blood. Under Christianizing influences the natives were induced to forego the blood-revenge for injuries, on receiving a

solatium  in goods or land, and so utu came to have the double meaning of revenge and recompense, and eventually became recognized as the Maori word for money.'

 Quote:  A. Maori contexts. Orig. a European rendering of the Maori noun utu, return (for anything ); satisfaction, ransom, reward,  price, reply' (Williams); not to be used confused with uto `revenge', a confusion evident in many of the explanations of the meaning of utu). 



The word widely used was in all the above senses by Europeans who had dealings with Maoris, from the general `return for work, injury, etc.' to the concrete `money' it is often found constructed with the definite article `the utu, hutu' etc. translating  the original Maori indefinite article, or adjective `some' he utu `an utu, some utu'. (Occas. constr with indef. article, see 1834). 



in later European usage the definite article was dropped to conform to English idiom eg' `give me the hoot' becomes `give me (some) hoot' The following is perhaps a `transitional' use 1828 C Davis journal Colenso Papers 3/18) `Another chief had been killed as a utu or payment'. (is this [ei utu] reflecting Maori [(h)e utu], as well as English  a for an?). 



The phonology, resulting in the English  hoot, parallels that of toot from  tutu, with the final unvoiced [u] not being heard by English ears. The initial [h] derives perhaps from a syncopation of [he utu]; but more prob. from the var. or error noted on p. 4 of 1842:  Maunsell Grammar of the New Zealand Language (4th ed) 1894: `in  pronouncing u, the speaker will have to guard against the error of those who prefix the aspirate when no aspirate is admissable. According to the u, utu, etc., are pronounced as if spelt hu, hutu.'.

Unlike Hongi, it was not at first so objectivable as used by English speakers (but cf the 1933 quotation). it is used by Maoris among themselves humorously or sardonically;  cf George, hongi @n.  (From Maori rendering of English George, formerly fairly common as a name among Maoris, esp. during reigns of Kings George iii-Vi; cf.)  1a. a  particular Maori named Hori

The hotels were at such a distance from each other as to allow the landlord of each to stand at his own door and watch with feelings of envy any unusual trend of customers seeking refreshment at the other. They were large, pretentious buildings of their class, with verandah and balcony to each, and were well-conducted inns, the accommodation afforded to travellers being all that could be expected - equal, indeed, to that of some of the best hotels in the larger centres.

 Quote:  [Two correspondents] wonder why the Dunedin rugby ground, Carisbrook, is called "The House of Pain." Otago rugby historian Dave McLaren says that several people claim to have coined the nickname, but the most likely person is ex-player (and children's book author) Brent Pope. Apparently, some time in the mid to late 80s, Pope was heard to exclaim, after a particularly hard training run inflicted on them by coach Laurie Mains, "Why the hell do we keep coming to this bloody house of pain?" it went public on September 27, 1992, when North Harbour coach Brad Mourant said much the same thing in his after-match function speech.

 Quote:  it is often assumed that the phrase [sc. the "House of Pain"] came to be applied by visiting teams because of the perceived difficulty of winning at Carisbrook. it actually began, however, in the late 1980s within the Otago team when players referred to Carisbrook as the House of Pain, because of exhausting training sessions. it was once attributed to an Otago player of the time, Brent Pope, and he happily claimed the credit for it, but it's difficult to pin down to one person. it's only in recent years that it's been seen as the House of Pain for visiting teams - a belief encouraged by Radio Sport (which began in 1998) commentators who had little or no acquaintance with either the ground or the phrase.

 Quote:  They could [22] have satisfied most of the `kinaki' [ed fn: Relish eaten with other food] wants from the coast, but preferred forest products. You found the incoming Ngati-Porou along the coast following the fishing grounds and the warm areas for kumara and taro cultivation, while the `tangata whenua' stuck to the hinter-land and forests, faring on `mamaku' [ed fn: Edible tree fern (Cyathea medullaris)], `aruhe', eels and huahua.

 Quote:  Knucklebones (K-34) was played in both Europe and Polynesia, independently at first. in the nineteenth century distinct European [177] and Maori versions were known. More recently, the two types have merged, and today the Maori children, who are mainly responsible for perpetuating the game in New Zealand, include in their games movements borrowed from the

European tradition. ... in most of the provinces the game was known as Knucklebones, and it is widely reported as having been played by New Zealand children of European origin until about 1900. Occasionally it was known as Chucks, Chuckstones, Chuckystones, Fingerstones, Hucklebones, Jacks, Jackstones, Knuckles, or Knucklestones. Children still played it here and there throughout the country in 1949, but they knew little about it until plastic knuckles were imported in 1954 in large quantities and revived the game.

 Quote:  An outsider might guess that our weather in the hills was almost always bad, to judge by the characteristic expressions used. The derisive phrases, `Send it down, Hughie' and `Let it come down, Hughie', go back to early in this century and are variants of the British military catch-phrase `Send it down, David'. `Send her down, Hughie', common in Australia's droughty climate, may not be so derisive. Judging by a verse attached to Dekker's Shoemaker's Holiday, St. Hugh has long been associated with rain.

 Quote:  The larvae [of longhorn beetles] are timber-borers. The huhu,  <i>Prionoplus reticularis</i>, also known as `horny bug', `crusty back' and `hum-bug' in adult life, is said to be a toothsome morsel in the grub stage-but should not be washed down with alcohol as its tissues already carry a fair amount from the wood it consumes.

Maoris the opportunity to keep alive precious traditions (eg, song, dance, oratory, spirituality) and remember the past. Huis allow large numbers to meet and come to a consensus.

 Quote:  One way in which it [the development programme] will do this is to 'hump and hollow' some of the pakihi soils and to 'flip' pasture. Humping and hollowing creates contoured surfaces to promote drainage. The plan at this stage is to turn all those properties that are able to be flipped or humped and hollowed into dairying.

 Quote:  Sheep - it is in their nature to be inconvenient - are invariably over or down or up there, and shepherds want them somewhere else. They must be hunted to that place, in dog trials off the flat and up the hill in the Straight Hunt. The ZigZag uses three sets of two poles to represent such obstacles and the dog must hunt the sheep left, then right, then left through them.

 Quote:  The Beardie was developed as a barking dog because in some parts of Scotland, particularly in the Western Highlands, much of the ground is covered with bracken, which combined with the deep gullies known as corries, makes it impossible for a heading dog to see his sheep. Here the

shepherd has to get out above the sheep and more or less chase them out of the thick cover. These dogs were known as hunters, and it is presumably an adaptation of this name which led to the designation, huntaway. At the turn of the century there were four well known strains of huntaways about North Canterbury and Marlborough - the Clown, Rag, Borderglen's Rose and Pollock's Old Clyde breeds. Of these the Clown strain certainly had Beardie blood, believed to have been started with a half Beardie brought out from Scotland.

 Quote:  The machine age on the gumfield appears to have been heralded as early as 1915 when an 

ingenious digger, whose name has unfortunately been forgotten, introduced what came to be known as the `hurdy-gurdy' or `gurdy.' ... [83] in its simplest form it was a tub, or a section of a

small galvanised iron tank, the bottom perforated with small holes. in the centre stood a strong, revolving, upright shaft, to the lower part of which was attached a wooden paddle, extending on both sides of the shaft, almost to the sides of the tank. The top of the revolving shaft was fitted with a horizontal handle, enabling the paddle to be swung to and fro in a half-circle. This simple machine was usually operated by two men; a supply of gum-bearing dirt having been put into the tank, buckets of water were thrown in by one man while the other vigorously turned the shaft handle this way and that, stirring up the soil while the muddy water flowed out through the perforations.

One of the very reasons she created HWAC (pronounced H-whack) last year was to set up a planning mechanism independent of the ministry. HWAC is now written into legislation as a permanent committee.

 Quote:  A HiGH COURT jury was told by Crown counsel Justin Smith in Wellington yesterday of a 

hire purchase `hydraulic deal' - a transaction, in which a hire purchase agreement stated a deposit had been paid whereas, in fact, it had not. ... Mr Smith said that during the trial the jury would hear about what was known colloquially as a `hydraulic deal'. This was a situation where there was a deal in which a dealer intended to sell a truck for, say, $50,000 and required a deposit of

$10,000 by any hire purchaser.  in the case of a $50,000 truck (a hypothetical example) the dealer knew the hire purchase company was going to have reservations about financing the full $50,000.  `So the dealer draws up a hire purchase agreement anyway. The real price is still $50,000. But on the agreement the dealer said he had received the sum of $10,000 by way of deposit.'  Mr Smith said that if a hire purchase company accepted the assignment of the agreement the dealer got his money in full and the customer got his truck (then claimed to be worth $60,000) without having to pay a deposit.
