Quote: Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement.  Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholdedwithout warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (I.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered. ... One H.P.R. could be taken out for each property and it was only businesslike that each runholder should use this right to secure 250 acres around his homestead against purchase by an outsider. An H.P.R. was initially intended to cover the owner's or manager's home, but, in the case of runs of over 5,000 acres, could be extended to cover an outstation.

Quote: The term `hack' as understood in this country is not at all to be conflicted with the same term as applied elsewhere to horse racing under that category. A hack in New Zealand is a horse that has not won a certain amount of moneys [sic], and so it is quite possible for the Derby favorite of the year, or the New Zealand Cup favorite to be a hack.

Parts of the Otago trawling grounds are termed `hospitals' by fishermen on account of the large number of wounded fish which have received the attention of the voracious hag-fish.

Quote: Hakari - this word referrred to the foodstand on which were displayed huge and varied amounts of food that a group was prepared to give its visitors, in order to maintain and increase their prestige or `mana'. (q.v.) The host group would make large personal sacrifices in order to feed visitors, and such sacrifice increased the sense of sharing both among hosts and between hosts and guests. Hakari now refers to the feast itself.

In Blenheim, Nelson, Picton and Wellington, a very  different fish, scientifically known as <i>Rexea solandri</i>, and closely related to the Barracouta, with obviously no affinities to the Cod family, is called `Hake' or `Southern Kingfish'. The name Hake applied to this fish is entirely wrong, as it belongs to the Snake Mackerel family, the <i>Gempylidae. </i><i>Ibid.</i> 154 SOUTHERN KINGFISH <i>Rexea solandri</i> (Cuv. & Val.) ...

(d) Principal localities where taken: Taken only rarely nowadays off Wellington in deep water; ... Whatever the position was years ago it is a fact that this fish is rare today. The position is further complicated by the almost indiscriminate use of the name hake, by fishermen, [for] other species of fish. ... The name Hake shold not be applied to either Southern kingfish or the Whiptail although there can be little, if any, objection to the commercial name of Blue Hake for the latter species.

Waite (<i>Records of the Canterbury Museum</i>, Vol. 1, No. 3) transferred the name Hake to <i>Merluccius gayi</i>, with Whiting as a second alternative common name. ... The most common name among Otago fishermen was Rock Cod, because this fish favours a rocky habitat.

Quote: The Cloudy Bay cod (<i>Lotella rhacinus</i>), also known as rock cod and southern hake, is rather more brown and lacks the dark blotch by the pectoral fin. <i>Ibid.</i> 1/898 HAKE is a name applied to several quite different marine fish in  different parts of the country. The whiting or haddock, <i>Merluccius  australis</i>, is a true hake, very similar to the North Sea species; it is, actually, often called English hake. It occurs in fairly deep  water south of Cook Strait. The southern kingfish, <i>Jordanidia  solandri</i>, is also known as hake: it is closely related and similar to the barracouta, and found throughout New Zealand. The Cloudy Bay cod, <i>Lotella rhacinus</i>, is sometimes known as southern hake.(see also Kingfish.)

Ha-ka-wai! in a drawn-out singsong with accent on the first and last syllables.

Quote: A strange bird in Maori eyes is the hakuai of the off-shore islands in the far south. ... Whole families go mutton-birding ... At night the fowlers gather round their camp-fires, and old songs are sung ... and ghost-stories retold. And in the darkness sometimes they hear the ghost-bird screaming its `Haku-ai, haku-ai, Ooh!' and then a hair-raising swoosh of great wings ... This bird, called the `hakuai' from its call, is spoken of as a spirit. ... The mystery of the  hakuai may be dispelled by assuming it to be ... the  frigate-bird (Fregata aquila).

Quote: The crown was called a bull, a cartwheel, a caser, five  bob, and most familiar of all a dollar, ... The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull,  half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and two-and-a-buck. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

Quote: At each place which I have visited, I have been assured that the Maories are dying rapidly - `perishing like rotten sheep,' these people often say; thus at Kurreroo or Molineux, where there are now half-a-dozen natives, they say that formerly, and at no remote period, about two generations previous to the present, there were above a thousand; and in many other places within the last sixteen years, which is about the extent of the experience of the older beachers, there has been, in many places, a corresponding diminution of numbers. If this is an unexaggerated statement, it is a very distressing one to reflect on. Since Dr. -- visited this settlement, one of the residents, Mr. --, an educated man, has opened a school for half-bred or any other children, and the progress which the children have already made is very encouraging.

This draws water in through an intake in the bottom of the hull and forces it out at high pressure, jet-like, through a nozzle in the rear. Unlike a conventional boat, the jet boat has neither propellor or rudder. Instead, it is pushed along, and steered, simply by the thrust of the jet stream

S.ds. run naturally either to bring sheep towards you or to drive them away; and when a puppy shows his preference he is broken in for that work.The dogs that bring sheep are called heading ds. (q.v.) and most of these can be taught to lead (q.v.) if desired. Dogs which take to driving sheep away are broken in to huntaway and are called htwys (q.v.). Some  dogs will both hd. and htwy and are called handy ds. They are not generally high-class heading dogs but very useful about hand and sometimes very useful mustering dogs. Some men have a special  slewing d., but a well-trained, hdg. dog or htwy. will usually slew (q.v.). (C.)

Quote: In our ranks was a very hard-headed gentleman by the name of Jensen who, on arriving at the pub, breasted up to the bar and ordered a `hangman's blood'. The barman confessed total ignorance of just what this drink might comprise. He was told to produce a beer handle, which he did, and was then ordered to go along [17] the entire length of the bar, putting in one nip of whatever spirits were on display. Now at that time spirits were very hard to come by, but Paul Rabone, the proprietor of the Mangatara Hotel, seemed to have an inexhaustible supply. Doing as he was bid the barman proceeded from one end to the other, putting in such things as scotch, gin, bacardi, rum, creme de menthe, and so on. He finally returned to the prospective quaffer of this incredible beverage with the beer mug about quarter-full of a purplish looking liquid. `Now,' said Jensen, `Fill it up with beer.'

Quote: From the spot where Huruhuru left us our path lay along a pebble ridge, with the sea on one side, and the lake Waihao on the other. This `hapua,' as all similar pieces of water are called, has no outlet to the sea except at times of floods, when one is made by the bank of pebbles breaking down at its weakest point: at other times its water oozes through the pebbles and sand. After leaving Waihao, which was nearly three miles long, we passed several small `hapua' similar to it. <i>Ibid.</i> 307 HAPUA, a shallow lake, the termination of a river, separated from the sea by a bank of sand or shingles.

Quote: The country rock separating two veins approximately parallel with each other has, in certain instances, been found to grade laterally from the vein-wall, where it assumes a highly propylitic facies, to a median rib of dark and only slightly altered rock. Theseribs or dyke-like masses are the `hard bars' of the miners. In some cases, however, these `hard bars' are probably due to dykes. <i>Ibid</i> 111 The `hard bars' of mining terminology are in most cases merely remnants of less-altered rock, but occasionally as in the case of the `bar' mentioned in the Golden Pah mine, they owe their existence to intrusives.

Quote: The chairman and main spokesperson for Hart believes the Rugby Union will not persist with the South African Tour if it means sacrificing rugby itself - and Hart intends the stakes should be that high.... On our TV sets his face is a perfect complement to the darker side of Hart's reputation - pale with intensity, piranha mouth, features a shale-slide of sharp angles, overall effect a combination of the fanatic's aggression and the martyr's masochism.

Hash House Harriers was started in Malaysia in 1938 by a handful of Britons. "They decided to have a hare and hound-type chase on a Monday evening."...The name Hash House came about because it was what these Britons called the boarding house where they lived.

Quote: Hatter: Whatever the origin of the phrase, `as mad as a hatter' can have been, I have often unsuccessfully endeavoured to discover. But doubtless it is from this phrase that the name of hatter has come to be applied in mining parlance, to one who works alone or without a mate. There are always a few of these unsocial miners about every digging, and their solitariness arises from every imaginable cause. Frequently they are misanthropes, sometimes placid contented creatures, who, so long as they can make a living by `fossicking' about, are happy. / [139]. My host was a hatter and he always kept a spare stretcher for any chance passer-by.

Quote: HATTER: a solitary, a digger who works alone. The derivation of this New Zealand expression is obscure. Archdeacon Harper described the hatters as `men who live and work by themselves, often old sailors and much travelled men, content with the solitude of well-kept huts, a few books, hard work, their dog as companion, perhaps some poultry, and a weekly visit on Saturdays to the townships to sell their gold and see friends. Whence the term `hatter' I have never discovered; maybe because such solitaries are regarded as `mad as a hatter'. Another possibility is suggested by the remark that the hatter `kept his whole world under his hat'.

I have sometimes at night given a stud lamb up for lost, left it in a hay box on the laundry floor and gone to bed, to be awakened in the small hours by the bleat of a lamb wanting milk.

Hay's Nurseries were well known and old established nurseries in Auckland, still going then, but I believe since closed down. I am not certain of the particular species but the plants have pinkish flowers and produce large numbers of tubers and of corms, by which it spreads and which are almost impossible to get rid of! I understand that Hay introduced the plant into N.Z. It is the only time I have heard the name used, and imagine that it was then obsolescent.

But I see to-day in `The Press' (June 27, 1933)  the editor speaks of a decrease of so many h. of sheep disclosed by this year's sheep return. (C.) (2) A dog goes round to the far side of  a mob of sheep and stops them. This is called heading. Hence  heading dog, one whose work this is. If he does it neatly he  makes a good h See also sheep dog. 3. The owner would say, `I can  head with him'.(C; [1874 Kennaway Crusts],p. 45)

The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiring branding, and after hauling them up to a corner post, leg-roped and threw them on [44] their side, placing a long lever on their neck and under the lowest rail so that they would not move much ... When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.

Water is taken from the head-ditch, which follows approximately the contour of the surface, into the distributing-furrows, which may be parallel with the ditch or diverge from it.

Quote: Heading. In the long head the competitor stands with his dog in a ring (1 chain in diameter) facing a hillside near the top of which three sheep are set loose.  When time is called the dog is dispatched, either on a left-hand or a right-hand cast, up the hill for some 800 yards to a point behind the sheep. On command the dog `lifts' the sheep and, keeping them together, `pulls' them in a direct line back to his master in the ring. To allow the dog to show complete control over the  sheep, the run ends with a `hold in the ring'. This involves stopping the sheep in the ring and holding them there. The first stages of the short head are much the same, but over half the distance, 400 yards. At the point where the sheep reach the shepherd, man and dog must drive them ahead down a `drive' which is 60 yards long and 1 chain wide and defined by short poles, to a set of hurdles which are 9 ft apart and parallel with the line of the drive. The sheep are driven between the hurdles and then down a second drive, similar to the first, to the pen or yard, which is 6 ft square. After opening one side, the competitor must stand by the pen gate until the sheep are yarded. The dog must do virtually all the work and his master's right of movement and intervention are strictly limited.

Quote: Fortunately there were many shrubs of <I>Dracophyllum longifolium. </I> growing in this locality, which even in their green state burn freely, and which enable the traveller in those regions, so much exposed to rain, to light a fire with comparative ease. This plant has needle-shaped leaves, generally of a brownsh tint,and small bell-shaped white flowers. It [115] is generally called a native heath by the Europeans. As some of the bushes grow to a height of ten feet with thick branches, it offers wood enough to keep up a cheerful fire.

Quote: At the war there were Froggy soldiers that always carried round little boxes - just little wee things less than the size of a matchbox. And inside there was a model of Christ on the cross - just a tiny thing. And over the top there was a word you could hardly read but it looked like H-E-N-R-I.  Well, Mr Anderson said, I could never work it out why they were called Henrys - that's what us diggers called them, little Henrys. D'you know, I've always meant to ask somebody why they were called that name.  And it was on the tip of Dave's tongue to explain, but he thought no. Because he'd have to explain why the I's weren't J's, and --[note 271:] ... His explanation of `little Henry' would have been based on I.N.R.I., Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, from Lat. Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum.

Quote: A cow with `a good test', that is, milk rich in butterfat, may be more valuable than another cow that gives more milk. About 1910 the practice rose of smpling milk from all the cows in a herd individually and testing the milk for its fat content. This process is called herd-testing. ... It is still not decided whether the word is hyphenated or not. I find it without a hyphen in a publication of the Department of Agriculture in 1950,  with a hyphen in a textbook of dairying in 1955. Pronunciation is with one stress, on herd. <i>Ibid.</i> 149 In New Zealand, everyone usesthe term herd-testing, not  milk-testing, because everyone thinks of the dairy industry from a producer's, not a consumer's, point of view.

If you want to boil a pot you have to hunt about for dead `Wild Irishmen' a nasty prickly little shrub. The high lands abounded with `Spaniards' I suppose from their cut-throat propensities. A kind of very thick grass, grows in a little lump.

Quote: The speech of the men is a slow drawl, sometimes flavoured with Scotch burr ... [fn] High country slang on sheep runs has national characteristics such as referring to a man as a `joker',and using the adjective 'crook' to describe bad weather or ill health, eg `I felt crook on the day the crook weather brought the river up'. Regional slang is also of interest, such as use of `dag' (literally wool fouled with sheep's dung) to mean a `hard case' or unusual character, with an implication of approval, even of admiration. `Rooster' is another variant of `joker'.

The <i>Zosterops</i> was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and ... we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; ... and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.

Quote: Many trampers today like the flexibility of planning their own routes, of not having the pace set by others. Some are put off by the "hisser" mentality, which is apparently still alive in some clubs. Hissers sprint from point to point, seeing nothing. At the hut they bore everyone senseless with their boasts about record times.

Quote: Visitors to Wellington comment on the brisk pace of the pedestrians, and Wellington trampers  have achieved a certain notoriety for the speed with which some of them travel in the hills. It is not surprising,  therefore, that its hillmen and hillwomen should hiss along, that hissers and little hissers should flourish, and that little hisser should sometimes be used as a term of approbation - `stew a  hisser', `a real hisser of a day'. The Tramper first gives to hiss in 1934, and hisser with reference to a stew appears on 1940, but to a person not until 1943, though it must have been so used long before.

Quote: The back country of New Zealand contains a heritage of about 1400 huts that is unequalled anywhere in the world. These huts were built for the following reasons: wild animal control (~750) sheep mustering (~500) recreation (~150) a range of other purposes including prospecting, scientific studies and castaway sustenance. Others began life as schools and homes and later became huts. These huts have heritage value as the only physical remnant of these activities. ...DOC is identifying a representative selection of key historic huts that can be managed long term to conserve this heritage and allow its appreciation. It is intended to have interpretation signs provided for each historic hut.

For a long time it has been known to the Maori and to Europeans that our New Zealand Whitebait is the young of a native freshwater fish commonly known as Minnow, or Inanga or Hiwi to the Maori, and erroneously called a Trout. ... The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. In the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.

Quote: The Golden Kiwi was established partly to prevent money being sent out of New Zealand for tickets in Tatt's, a Tasmanian lottery with a name abbreviated from Tattersall's and quite unconnected with the English cant word tatts `dice'. It was illegal to sell tickets in Tatt's in New Zealand but many barbers' shops displayed a notice, `We communicate with Hobart', which wasuniversally understood.... It was clear that in the context of a barber's shop window the notice meant `we sell tickets in Tatt's', but legally a man can announce that he writes to Tasmania. Newspapers might report the good fortune of winners but the illegal source of the winnings would not be specified. The money came from `an overseas consultation'.

Quote: Ages of sheep. Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram  lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until  cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a  four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an  eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy

Quote: Hokonui sheep are out of the same hills [as Hokonui whisky] and although not illegal, are certainly a curiosity. A fairly original form of Merino, they've run wild for well over a century and have developed, or reverted to, quite a few distinct characteristics. There's the varying shades of black, brown and grey with a wee dash of white on the forehead and a white tip on the tail...'They're just different,' he says. 'Things like positioning of bones and teeth, everything from the traditional farm animal breeding world, you can forget about when it comes to Hokonuis. They're as tough as old boots and interesting in their grazing habits. They prefer rough feed and will eat heads and thistles before they touch the clover.'..Interested though he is, there's no way Peter will reduce the Coopworth flock in concession to the Hokonuis.

Quote: Hokonui Swindle more recent name for and/or version of the Hokitika Swindle, a pub game aimed at financing further drinking. Baker identified the Hokitika version as based on a method of counting `whereby the person who calls a certain number in a sequence pays a specified sum into the jackpot'. Glenn Johnston defines the Hokonui version as a drinking game that combineselements of chance with the ability to hold your liquor and follow a few simple rules - though the deviousness of the caller can also influence proceedings. The aims are simple: to liven things up, get a bit of alcohol consumed quickly and sort the stayers from the pikers.

Quote: In the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (In more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

It simply means the United Kingdom, and is used without emotion, as a word that has been handed down from father to son, and mother to daughter. It is part of the real New Zealand language, a genuine piece of Antipodean slang. And, like all slang, it has its significance.

The generation for which the New Zealand Herald catered in leading articles had almost passed away. Your lectures throughout New Zealand had set the best minds among the pakeha at work. With that generation also had largely passed the pakeha who was wedded to the idea of England being `Home'. The native born New Zealand pakeha is looking nearer to his native heath for objects of study, literary effort and missionary care.

Quote: The Home Guard has atrtracted little attention from historians... There was nothing glamorous about the Home Guard... It was nearly a year after war was declared that the War Cabinet finally laid plans for the formation of a volunteer Home Guard, to comprise men who were too old or to young to serve overseas, or who were being kept at home in essential occupations... The urgency and seriousness of the war eventually forced Home Guard units to be set up in almost every settlement and town in the country... The Home Guard in New Zealand eventually numbered 12,000 in its ranks.

Quote: The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

Quote: It is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, I only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings.

That is, `My town house is a townhouse', correctly distinguishes, on the page, and will be distinguished in speech; tow stresses for the one, and one stress (TOWNhouse) for the other. There is as well a question of nuance to be noticed. A townhouse is emphatically upmarket from a home unit.

Quote: Hollywood ensured the words Home Alone were something to chuckle about. A 10-year-old's mischievous romps while left to his own devices were laughed at by millions.However, In New Zealand the phrase has a more depressing definition. "Home alone" is synonymous with the neglect of children for their welfare or the foolhardy belief "nothing can go wrong" even if mum and dad are just popping to the shops for 15 minutes....The home-alone law has been accused of hurting children because fining parents meant there would be less money for the family.

Quote: The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

In the old days the owner's residence, but only if it was some distance from the rest of the station buildings (see big house). when the Goverment began cutting up the runs in the 'nineties, they or their surveyors adopted the word to signify what had been formerly called the station, and the new settlers followed them, so that the new sense of the word is now widely used. Butler and Sir F. Weld also use it in the modern sense, but in writing for Englishmen. (C.R.)

The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.  <i>Ibid.</i> 275 The richest claim was always a `homeward-bounder'. A Nelson digger recalled how at work his mates talked of `trips to Europe, going back for a week, and astonishing the Natives generally'. <I>Ibid.</I> 329 J. F.

The adulterer gets out of his bed, and tries to creep out under cover of darkness. Rastus hears him,in the dark, and says `Hoo dat?' being answered by silence, until the adulterer bumps into him in the dark, and says himself `Hoo dat?' Rastus immediately says `Hoo dat who say hoo dat'. The story has many variants, and is variously placed in stage Black, Maori or Aboriginal contexts.

Quote: A Tour in Australia and New Zealand 55 Concentration of grazing carries with it other important effects - the benefits of what Bruce Levy has so appropriately termed 'hoof cultivation.' In New Zealand the soil dries so rapidly after rain that the 'hoof' seldom does harm and most frequently only does good - provided of course that a period of rest follows a period of excessive 'cultivation.' The combined application of 'hoof cultivation' and judicious feeding out is a method definitely employed for grass land improvement in New Zealand.

Quote: `There are several specimens of bush slang transplanted from the Maori language. `Hoot' is a very frequent synonym for money or wage. I have heard a shearer at the Pastoralist Union office in Sydney when he sought to ascertain the scale of remuneration, enquire of the gilt-edged clerk behind the barrier, `What's the hoot, mate?' The Maori equivalent for money is utu, pronounced by the Ngapuhi and other northern tribes with the last syllable clipped, and the word is very largely used by the kauri-gum diggers and station hands in the North Island. The original  meaning of first settled in New Zealand, they found that the savage inhabitants had no conception of any recompense except the grim recompense of blood. Under Christianizing influences the natives were induced to forego the blood-revenge for injuries, on receiving asolatium  in goods or land, and so utu came to have the double meaning of revenge and recompense, and eventually became recognized as the Maori word for money.'

Quote: A. Maori contexts. Orig. a European rendering of the Maori noun utu, return (for anything ); satisfaction, ransom, reward,  price, reply' (Williams); not to be used confused with uto `revenge', a confusion evident in many of the explanations of the meaning of utu). The word widely used was in all the above senses by Europeans who had dealings with Maoris, from the general `return for work, injury, etc.' to the concrete `money' It is often found constructed with the definite article `the utu, hutu' etc. translating  the original Maori indefinite article, or adjective `some' he utu `an utu, some utu'. (Occas. constr with indef. article, see 1834). In later European usage the definite article was dropped to conform to English idiom eg' `give me the hoot' becomes `give me (some) hoot' The following is perhaps a `transitional' use 1828 C Davis journal Colenso Papers 3/18) `Another chief had been killed as a utu or payment'. (Is this [ei utu] reflecting Maori [(h)e utu], as well as English  a for an?). The phonology, resulting in the English  hoot, parallels that of toot from  tutu, with the final unvoiced [u] not being heard by English ears. The initial [h] derives perhaps from a syncopation of [he utu]; but more prob. from the var. or error noted on p. 4 of 1842:  Maunsell Grammar of the New Zealand Language (4th ed) 1894: `In  pronouncing u, the speaker will have to guard against the error of those who prefix the aspirate when no aspirate is admissable. According to the u, utu, etc., are pronounced as if spelt hu, hutu.'.
