"It's an extremely delicate subject.. particularly among older Polynesians, because in New Zealand the fa'afafine are part of the gay scene; they've become much more visible and upfront about something that in Samoa is an accepted part of their culture. I think some Polynesians feel that the fa'afafine have become an embarrassment to who we are."

They do the sewing, the ironing and the cooking and they look after people," says one of the women. Then there is the next generation of fa'afafine who are seen more as drag queens.

 Quote:  Daryla is what is known as a fa'afafine or feminine man... The tradition of fa'afafines, which literally means "like a woman", is unique to Samoan and Tonga culture. A fa'afafine dresses in women's clothes, has a woman's name and talks and walks like a woman. They prefer straight men... My understanding of the fa'afafine tradition was that in Samoan culture, if a family had no daughters, then the youngest boys is treated as a girl and kept at home to help the mother. These boys then grow up to be fa'afafines.

 Quote:  If you strike something "fair and square" you strike it accurately and with force. A new meaning had been born - complete(ly), forceful(ly). A woman who tells you she is "fair affronted" is (a) severely insulted and (b) from the north of the UK. This usage has found its way into New Zealand colloquial idiom: " It fair gets me down"; "I feel fair sick when I come to think of it"; and (of course) "It's a fair cow" which takes "fair" a long way from its original sense of "beautiful".

 Homonym Number:

 Definition: A handsome flycatcher of the New Zealand bush. Pre-settlement North Island writers prefer piwaka(waka) (Markham 1834, Yate 1835);  early more-or-less scientific writers prefer fantailed (less often fantail) flycatcher, or merely flycatcher; fantail as a popular name is attested in 1845 (1854) (Wellington), 1851 (Taranaki) and sanctioned by Buller (1873 (1888)). Also called piwakawaka, tiwakawaka,  shortened from fantail(ed) flycatcher, Rhipidura flabellifera, Pied or North Island Fantail,  =piwakawaka; and <I>R. fuliginosa</I>, Black or South Island Fantail, =tiwaiwaka.

discrimination in regard to several apparently prime blacks, his answer was that they `killed' badly. So many statements, nevertheless, continue to be accepted because it is nobody's interest to disprove them, that this dealer's belief is given for what it was worth. On the other hand, what Sandy Grant did not know of sheep was not worth knowing.

[fn 10] The New Zealand variety of this herb is <I>Chenopodium triandrum</I>. It may be added, as a philogical curiosity, that Bank's words, taken over into Hawkesworth, become in OED the first literary mention of `lambs' quarters', though `fat-hen' is here ignored in favour of a 1795 appearance.

then takes two or three bundles and puts them in a barrel (heavy end down). He then takes the longest leaves and places them on a bench convenient to the `feeder'. ...[44] The `feeder' takes each blade separately and places the butt end into the `stripper' which takes the green outer covering off. ... The fibre as it leaves the stripper is caught by the `fly boy', who collects enough to make into a hank, which he places convenient for the `shaker'. The latter, with a motion like cracking a whip, gets rid of as much rubbish as possible, after which he places the hank handy for the `washer'. This man places the fibre in a vat, through which ... clean water is running.

 Quote:  On good land where spring growth is vigorous light feeding off of cereals with sheep will prevent lodging, increase tillering, and improve the yield. Hard feeding off, especially on the lighter land, where grazing may not be advisable at all, tends to reduce yields. Feeding off is generally carried out in August if the ground is sufficiently dry .. After feeding off the crop should be tine harrowed to loosen the surface.

Natives of Brazil and Uruguay, feijoas were first introduced to New Zealand as seed in 1908... Now New Zealand is at the forefront of research on feijoas and is probably the only country that exports the fruit.

Their rich flavour goes a long way, which is good if you're short on either feijoas or cash - you can bulk out a feijoa crumble and even that chutney with apples at a third of the price.

 Quote:  The corps known as the Royal New Zealand Fencibles, ... was a body of veteran soldiers converted into military settlers, established through Governor Grey's efforts as a protection for the southern frontier of the Auckland Settlement. It consisted of discharged British soldiers, about three-fourths of them pensioners, and all men of approved character and physique. The corps was enrolled in England in 1847. The term of service in New Zealand was to be seven years (most of the soldiers became permanent settlers); ... on arrival in the colony each Fencible was given possession of a two-roomed cottage and an acre of land ... The members of the corps

were required to attend six days' drill in the spring and six in autumn, and to attend church parade every Sunday, fully armed, for inspection. ... The settlements in which the pensioners were established were Onehunga, Otahuhu, [451] Panmure, and Howick; these places were practically founded as villages by the Fencibles.

 Quote:  The first care of the settler was to increase his area of grass by the operation known through Hawke's Bay as `fern-crushing' or `fern-grinding,' - words ominous of the part played by the unfortunate sheep, and which will be described later. It is sufficient now to state that after fire had cleared the tangled bracken growth, the ground was surface-sown and kept clear by browsing sheep. As the greatest growth of fern took place during late spring, it was then impossible to have too many sheep. Every squatter in Hawke's Bay was in the 'eighties `fern-grinding,' so that

in those times sheep could not be bought at that season of the year. The result was that every sheep likely to survive the winter was kept, however old and however fleeced. It was at least a pair of jaws, a beast that could bite bracken.

 Quote:  `I got six figs for that load of rubbish' Fig was a curious word, an Americanism that had some how filtered into N.Z [sic] penal institutions and survived. It wasn't slang in the sense that screw and boob were. There was no other word for the cellophane packet that contained around fifty grammes of offcuts and substandard tobacco supplied by the companies. Nobody spoke of a  packet of tobacco - it was always a fig.

 Quote:  ROUGH LEATHER JACKET, TRIGGER-FISH or FILE-FISH (KOKIRI) <i>Parika scaber</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... This interesting fish has a number of other vernacular names, such as File-fish, and all with a bearing on its construction. The name Leather-Jacket is due to the fancied resemblance to a North American lumber jacket, not unlike the dark brown coloured jumpers used by hikers. The word rough is attached to the name Leather Jacket by fishermen, because the scales are furnished with sharp points which make the skin so rough that one's fingers cannot be rubbed freely in a direction from tail to head without losing part of one's skin, hence the name File-fish.

 Quote:  With the true whales (Balaenoidea)[sic] it has the following characters in common: - Baleen elongate and of fine quality; chest and belly smooth; tympanic bones rhombic; cervical vertebrae anchylosed; mandibular ramus without a coronoid process.  To the finners (or finbacks) [fn. Whalers often speak of right whales as finners or fin-fish, from their yielding baleen or `fin', as they term it. [HWO note: is he implying that right whales are true whales but are also (?mistakenly) called finners by whalers: I don't think so.]] it had the following points of resemblance:- Body elongate and slender, the proportion of head being less than one fourth [253] of the length; has a dorsal fin; pectoral fin lanceolate, moderate, and with four fingers; scapula elongate, with coracoid and acromion processes. Its peculiar characters are the small number of vertebrae, 44; the short mandibles and remarkably broad straight ribs with feeble vertebral articulations.

 Quote:  What about giving the lowdown on terms like bailing and finding ... Could you describe the things a good pig dog's required to do? ... There's two types of finders. There's the wind finder and the track finder. The wind finder will take a pig first ... If you've got a good wind finder with you and you're working the right way into the wind, if there's a pig lying anywhere up to 1000 or 1500 yards away he'll be away like a shot ... With a track finder the pig might be on the move and he'll leave a lot of scent on the undergrowth. The dog will immediately pick that up and he'll stick his nose on the ground ... He'll tail off after the pig and stop him some way, nip him in the leg or somewhere else.

 Quote:  There are numerous families of slime fungus in New Zealand, but, unfortunately, they are not particularly easy to find, as they are rather small, and one must look for them in just the right 

kind of place, and choose moist, damp weather. Of course, they are not confined to the bush; one of them may be discovered in vegetable gardens, for it is parasitic on cabbages, causing the disease known as `fingers and toes.'

 Quote:  Knucklebones (K-34) was played in both Europe and Polynesia, independently at first. In the  nineteenth century distinct European [177] and Maori versions were known. More recently, the two types have merged, and today the Maori children, who are mainly responsible for perpetuating the game in New Zealand, include in their games movements borrowed from the European tradition. ... In most of the provinces the game was known as Knucklebones, and it is widely reported as having been played by New Zealand children of European origin until about 1900. Occasionally it was known as Chucks, Chuckstones, Chuckystones, Fingerstones, Hucklebones, Jacks, Jackstones, Knuckles, or Knucklestones. Children still played it here and there throughout the country in 1949, but they knew little about it until plastic knuckles were

imported in 1954 in large quantities and revived the game.

probably come from what the Fiordlanders

call a tree avalanche. Because Fiordland

was so thoroughly gouged by glaciers,

there is virtually no topsoil on the

steeper valley sides. Even the fully-

grown forest has only the precarious hold

of a woven skin of roots that stretch

over rock. This net has a weak grip and

if one section tears free it can peel the

forest from the cliff-faces in great

strips. The fall of just one tree can

trigger a tree avalanche.

 Quote:  Fire in the fern for trouble or smouldering discontent. The  expression to spread like fire in the fern, used of a rumour and even of an epidemic, is useful as well as alliterative. Dealing with the 

Maori Wars in the Sydney Telegraph as recently as February, 1940, a writer says: `The fire in the fern has now gone out. Justice is being done to the Maori', which reveals that in Australia the phrase is linked with New Zealand.

 Quote:  But the most common name for the first group of New Zealand soldiers to see active service in the Middle East during the Second World War is the First Echelon ...  Soon after New Zealand declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, a call went out for volunteers for a special force comprising a wide range of army units.  The use of the military term `Echelon' in the sense of first, second or third echelon has puzzled many people. It refers to the position of an army in the form of steps or parallel lines, each line being a little to the left or right of the preceding one. However, the name was given because the main groups of New Zealanders sent overseas in previous wars had been called contingents.

 Quote:  Action terms which refer to the shooting of the marbles are: Knuckle down Stiff, Knee High, Funks [Flunks sic] or Funnicks, Slips, Firsts and Lasts and Forces. ... The term `Knuckle down

Stiff' (Taranaki [18]80, Gisborne [18]85, Waitara [18]95) is mentioned by [Lady A.B. Gomme Vo. 1, p.113]. ... As Taranaki [18]80 says, `The term was called out in order to prevent too easy a success against a marble near the ring'. It was less advantageous to fire with the hand on the ground than with the hand elevated, perhaps at `Knee High'.

 Quote:   [It is stated that in 1889 Alhambra came from Dunedin to play Merivale and played only one half-back instead of two. The man who would have been the second half-back `stood between [the half-back] and the three-quarters line.' The Club had no name for the new position, and some discussion took place about it. The argument was ended when a Merivale player said that if the new position was between half and three-quarters, he must be five-eighths. The name was adopted.]

 Quote:  The pivot for most of Alhambra's attacks [sc. in a game in Dunedin between Kaikorai and Alhambra in 1890] was the extra player between the halfback and the three-quarter line.  After the game players from both sides sat around discussing tactics and a Merivale back, one F. Childs, is credited with coming up with the new name, five-eighths. A blacksmith, Childs obviously thought logically. If the player was not a half and was not a threequarter, he said, he was between the two and therefore must be a five-eighth.

 Quote:  Frequently the surplus grass runs to seed and afterwards there is a great deal of what graziers call 'flag.' This flag is neglected by the sheep; they prefer the shorter green grass. In danthonia country, therefore, as in rough bush country, it is profitable to run a limited number of cattle among the sheep. They clean up this rough 'flag', break through bushy and rushy obstacles and thus purify the pasture for the sheep.

Two pairs gave the aircraft the marks to run in and out, and the this pair then had time to move into a new position. From eight to ten men were engaged on the job during the progress of the spraying, including some of the station shepherds who acted as flagmen to direct the pilot on each run.

 Quote:  FLANNEL LEAF (<I>Verbascum thapsus</I>) is commonly called mullein in England, and is frequently so called here as well. Its commonest local name is probably tobacco plant, or native tobacco, a name for which there is no justification in either appearance or use. Velvet mullein, woolly mullein, golden rod, and Aaron's rod are other appellations, but flannel leaf, one of the common sheep-station names is both descriptive and distinctive. The plant is found in dry soil and river beds ... in both islands.

 Quote:  The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as `government rags', were given various nicknames such as assignats, `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past.  Assignats was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution,

but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters'--sometimes written `skinplasters'--had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.

One theory is that when Chinamen hawked fish about Dunedin they kept Flatheads for their own consumption, as they preferred them to all other fish.

 Quote:  Family  URANISCOPIDAE. The flathead, <i>Kathetostoma giganteum</i> ..., is usually found on its own, often burrowing in the sea bed with just the eyes and mouth showing. It shares this way of lifeq (and its wide heavy heady, flattened on top, eyes staring upwards) with the stargazers and catfish. Some fishermen call it chinaman.

The trucks were built with two-thirds of the weight on the front axle to enable a man to lift the rear-end while turning the truck.

 Quote:  <i>Flax</i>: Phormium Tenax. `The poor man's friend.' This plant, shaped like a giant tussock, was one of the most useful things that grew. The leaves or `blades' were ready-made straps and ropes for almost any purpose. The bush makes an excellent dog-kennel, and many a man has made a comfortable camp under one on a rough night. It is handy to tie a horse to and very good shelter for shorn sheep. The leaves are easily skinned; and the fibre was used for making crackers for stock and bullock whips. The individual plants are called <i>flax bushes</i> and the dried reed stalks (which Maoris and children tied into bundles to make rafts) are  called <i>flax-sticks, koradi</i> ss. o[r] <i>kraddy</i> ss., I suppose a  corrupted Maori word. On native country <i>flax</i> is always a sign of good land. ([1857 Paul Letters from Canterbury], p.96; [1898 Morris Austral-English])

 Quote:  The term `flax' for the genus <i>Phormium</i>, although firmly established, is yet another inappropriate common name as <i>Phormium</i> and true linen flax  (<i>Linum</i>) have in common only the possession of useful  fibres. Mountain flax is <i>Phormium cookianum</i> and its tufts of narrow, leathery leaves may be conspicuous in poorly drained places in tussock herbfield and shrubland.

 Quote:  Hence, next to bush and swamp-land proper (on alluvial clays), Flax-land is regarded as the most desirable for agricultural purposes. `Flax-swamps' are frequently as common as `Tussock-swamps,' though their soil is far from being so wet or watery. Like the `Tussock-swamps,' they are frequently very `tussocky' - causing walking thereon to be extremely ... fatiguing.

 Quote:  Hence, next to bush and swamp-land proper (on alluvial clays), Flax-land is regarded as the most desirable for agricultural purposes. `Flax-swamps' are frequently as common as `Tussock-swamps,' though their soil is far from being so wet or watery. Like the `Tussock-swamps,' they are frequently very `tussocky' - causing walking thereon to be extremely ... fatiguing.

Cleared bush-land is suitable for the cultivation of the flax plant, and even swamp-land is improved by drainage. In the various flax

swamps near nelson ...the finest plants grow upon the soil that has been thrown out of the ditch ...

 Quote:  The spotted shag, or flip-flap, well known to our shore folk, is stated by ornithologists to be peculiar to New Zealand; its active movements enliven many a bluff headland or rocky inlet of

our island coast line... In calm autumn days often have we watched the still waters of our shallow bays flash with the swift motion of the flip-flap.

 Quote:  The most innovative soil improvement technique to be used in the conversions will be pasture flipping - a practice pioneered at Cape Foulwind to bring free-draining soils to the surface and turn sour wetland into lush pasture .. A group of Cape Foulwind dairy farmers, together with Agriculture New Zealand consultant Richard Reynolds, and Landcare Research Scientist Dr Craig Ross, are evaluating flipping or breaking up the pakihi iron pan to bring free-draining soil to the top. The technique was developed by a local farmer, the late Fred King, and his son Alex, and costs between $2500 and $5000 a hectare.

These blanketings I found have ... a decidedly acid reaction, due ... to the presence of ferric and ferrous salts ..., and it is to the former ... that what is commonly known as [335] `flouring,' is mainly due, in the process cited above; such ferric salts being able to either oxidize or chloridize the surface of any mercury ..., thus enfilming it with a compound, which being practically insoluble in water ... prevents that metallic contact taking place between detached mercurial globules, which is necessary to amalgamation.

 Quote:  When the flax arrives at the mill it is weighed and credited to the cutter. The `bench loader' then takes two or three bundles and puts them in a barrel (heavy end down). He then takes the longest leaves and places them on a bench convenient to the `feeder'. ...[44] The `feeder' takes each blade separately and places the butt end into the `stripper' which takes the green outer covering off. ... The fibre as it leaves the stripper is caught by the `fly boy', who collects enough to make into a hank, which he places convenient for the `shaker'. The latter, with a motion like cracking a whip, gets rid of as much rubbish as possible, after which he places the hank handy for the `washer'. This man places the fibre in a vat, through which ... clean water is running.

 Quote:  A recent invention can, however, save a lot of bleary eyes and night shifts - the foaling alarm. It's a battery-powered transmitter that's fixed to a collar round the mare's neck so that when she lies down to foal, it triggers an alarm beside Nick's bed. The alarm not only eliminates night staff, but puts a lot less stress on the mare.

There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were

Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

 Quote:  "Fong" or "fong-eye" was popular about the same time, to mean booze in general, but since this was 1950s New Zealand, in practice it meant only beer... Fong and its derivatives are rather unusual in New Zealand slang in not being shared with Australia.

Huntaways are sometimes spoken of as forcing dogs; but the term force is also applied to the ability of a heading dog to pull sheep. (C.)

The kauri forest, like the mixed podocarp forest, the sub-tropical rain forest, ... and such-like are terms that come from the botanist and forester, not from the layman - or from the bushman.

The Accord was built upon the Tasman Accord, negotiated in 1988 between Forest and Bird and Tasman (now Fletcher) Forests, following lively protest against the company's clear-felling of native forest to plant pine trees. Both accords saw conservationists agree to champion sustainable pine forests, and the forestry companies agree not to plant pine trees at the expense of native forest.

 Quote:  It may be remarked that National Park is American in origin, dating from 1872, about the time that Yosemite was set aside for recreational purposes. In England, park, like forest, may have a definite legal meaning when it applies to a tract of land held by royal grant for keeping beasts of the chase. Unlike a forest, a park is enclosed, and [31] it does not have special laws or offices. In all the uses to which park has been put in England, until the recent adoption of National Park, there has been the idea of enclosure, as there is in the cognate paddock. The term forest park, as in the Tararua Forest Park, would once have seemed a contradiction in terms.

 Quote:  Though his assertions may be discounted the spirit of Saunders's utterances may be taken as a reflection of the attitude of the popular party. In commenting on the fact that the power acquired by `the Original Resident Land Purchasers' Association' was retained long after the Company had ceased to exist, Saunders states `It became a leading and bitter opponent, a dangerous and mischievous class combination, facetiously called `The Nelson Supper Party' and more viciously called also `The Forty Thieves'. This party was very ably led by Dr., afterwards Sir David, Monro, and retained all political power in their own hands until some time after the introduction of representative government into this country.

 Quote:  In the outset of the Company's colonisation scheme, there were certain individuals who, by their disinterestedness in forwarding the establishment of the Company's first and principal settlement, obtained the sobriquet of the Forty Thieves ; and it appears that some individuals forming a portion of the Company's second Colony were anxious to rival the above-named gentlemen in a similar line of conduct. The one set proposed, that no individual holding less than five original land-orders in the settlement, should be eligible to a seat in their self- elected Council for the republican settlement of Britannia, well knowing at the time that none but themselves were qualified under such [a regulation, seeing that they were the holders of ten gratuitous landorders from the Company. The Nelson resident original landpurchasers, on the other hand, propose to exclude all persons who are not, like themselves, resident original purchasers, but who still originally emigrated here, and have become holders of land by purchase from them and the absentee land proprietors, and have embarked their labour and capital for various purposes, thereby promoting the welfare of the settlement, from any right to runs for cattle and sheep upon the waste lands.

As staple as beer is, more so is the game of `forty-fives', impossible of definition, where the five of the trump suit beats all other cards and the table gets a thumping. It accumulates all the good-natured interest and noise of which pubs are capable.

 Quote:  In smoky little back parlours [in Westport] friendly little groups meet to play `forty-fives' with uproarious oaths and much heavy thumping of the table. For [100] the uninitiated it may be stated that in this  game the five-fingers (the five of the trump suit) beats all other cards. The trump suit order is five, jack, ace, king queen - all other suits begin with the king. Non-trump suits win high in red; low in black. Obviously the ace of diamonds is the lowest card in the pack unless diamonds are trumps, in which case it is the fourth best. The word `obviously' in the preceding sentence is a little optimistic - as the ace of hearts (the Maggy) is always the third best trump. It is credibly  reported (a) that the game is of Irish origin (b) that there  are no written rules (c) that the game can only be learned by  playing it, and (d) it is as characteristic of Westport as whitebait or coal.

 Quote:  The game played was called Forty-fives, and he could make neither head nor tail of the method of play. There was no money on the table, but a record of games played and won was made on a cribbage board by shifting a match about in the holes. At the conclusion of each game and [sic] a score of forty-five was reached, the losers shouted drinks for the other players, and the cards were shuffled round again. ... The fourth man stood up and excitedly thumped the table with the five of hearts. `I've been waiting for that, twenty-five - one - five, now lead and keep leading.'  Play and conversation went on in a similar strain. Dave endeavoured explain the rudiments of the game. `The sequence of the game is highest in red cards and lowest in black. The highest card in the pack is the five of whatever suit turns up, then comes the Jack, and the ace of hearts is always the third highest trump in the pack. But you'll never learn the game looking on, it's too hard to follow. They play four legs to a game 
which is called a `horse.' Jim's playing a hundred pounds a game, twenty pounds a leg, and twenty pounds at the completion of the game. Then they start again.'

 Quote:  Ages of sheep. Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A 

sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram  lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until  cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a  two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a  four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an  eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

 Quote:  The evidence for the defence is that a four-tooth ewe ceases to be a four-tooth as soon as the fifth tooth, or the fifth and sixth tooth, appear through the gums... The witnesses for the plaintiff... are unanimous in their opinion that a ewe two and a-half years old is still a four-tooth ewe, although the fifth and sixth teeth have appeared... I have accordingly to settle the matter as follows - a ewe is correctly defined as a four-tooth until the fifth and sixth tooth reach maturity.

There was slots, there was lumps, there was packing fragies in bottlos, there was the tying down of the north line for a clearance, the scissors, lead seals and squeezers. The sorters on call-back flicking circulars with precision. The volcanoes of letters on the facing-up table, the checker chanting the reds onto the

lorry, the checker calling the overseas in, London 45 ... The queue of men working at the parcel depot or the postal siding ... Tieing down the cargon. ... The sorters' school at the posties' pub known colloquially as Box 44 or the B.B.C., the Back Bar of the Cecil. The cheerful abuse of

 Quote:  Both the aim and the object of those who frame laws in favor of special settlements, free selectors, deferred payment, and small farm associations are admirable ... If a portion of the progress payments is remitted by the state to the Southland free-selectors, the practical result will be that they will ultimately obtain their land for a less price than they originally agreed to pay for it.

 Quote:  At the end of the evening someone suggested we finish up with a `freeze out' and this was agreed to. The rules of this form of sport were simple. Each player has to have three threepenny pieces and on the first round all put in one threepence. An ordinary poker hand was then dealt and cards were bought as required. There was no betting as all hands were tabled face up and the man with the worst hand was `frozen out'. All he had to do however, was to put in his second threepence and he was in again. After losing three threepences, however, he was frozen out for good. This

went on until only two players remained and on the final game the winner took the whole kitty!

 Quote:  In 1932, wages were cut, and the freezing workers struck throughout the country. The butchers didn't believe that they could be replaced, but when the works reopened it was found that the

companies had installed the American chain system, with each worker responsible for only one aspect of the process. The butchers were replaced by the unemployed, who initially made a terrible mess of the carcasses. But in time they became competent process workers, as opposed to the tradesmen who had preceded them. <i>Ibid.</i> 86 

The freezing workers sent in a short line-out to meet them: Kennedy and Scott from the New Zealand union, Evans from Auckland and Douglas and Knox from the FOL.

The name is said to be derived from the circumstance that the fish is found alive on New Zealand sea-beaches on frosty nights. It is called the <i>Scabbard-fish</i> in Europe, because it is like the shining  white metal sheath of a long sword. <i>Lepidopus</i> belongs to the family <i>Trichiurida</i>; it reaches a length of five or six feet, but is so thin that it hardly weighs as many pounds. It is considered a delicacy in New Zealand.

 Quote:  FROSTFISH <I>Lepidopus caudatus</I> ... Frostfish have a scaleless body and are a uniform bright silver colour. They spend the cold winter months in deep offshore water beyond the edge of the continental shelf and apparently come to the surface on clear still nights when the moon is full; although it maybe that they are on the surface at other times but are not seen because of the dull rough conditions. ... They are occasionally found stranded on beaches.

 Quote:  Ages of sheep. Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A  sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram  lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

Harold (Jack) Underwood made lead slush tops and semiflat figures in his basement as a hobby, unaware that those experiments would become the success that enabled him to resign from the public service and enter the toy-making business... There is an absolutely positively Wellington origin about the distinctive Fun Ho! trademark, too. The design with exclamation nmark was by the late E Mervyn Taylor, a New Zealand arrist who worked in the city at the same time as an illustrator and commercial artist... The earliest Fun Ho! models were made from lead and appear to have been produced in Wellington.

 Quote:  At one time Jacobs leased about 2000 acres of the usually useless [Chatham] Tobacco Country. He wanted it for the fungus that grew so abundantly on the kopi trees which formed the main portion of that forest. This he gathered to export to China. The very large, soft circular fungus could also be induced to grow on logs and roots split open and placed in an old tin shed. There copious watering soon covered everything with the huge white growth and all Jacobs had to do was to pull it off the logs and spread it out to dry. A pile a foot or so high would only yield a few handfuls of dry chips. When ready for packing it had to be damped once more to keep it from turning into powder. It never went mouldy because it was a mould to start with. When first sent abroad the Islanders got 4d. a pound for it, later only 2d. Even at that price they stripped the forests and killed the goose. Jacobs seems to have been the only one who attempted to cultivate it. The Chinese used it for soup (it makes a thick, sticky, rather tasteless fluid when boiled), dressing silk and varnish.

 Quote:  [Waitara, Taranaki, 1899: reference, game of Little Ring] Many heated arguments arose as to who said `everythings' or `nothings' first. If a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime.

 Quote:  Fuzzy melon (<i>Benincasa hispida</i>). This species of gourd was everywhere at the Victoria St market last week, but only Asian people appeared to be buying it. The fuzzy melon is aptly named - its surface needs to look like it is carrying a bristly two-day growth, otherwise you know it has been picked too old. A Chinese friend told me fuzzy melon is good for taking on the flavours of whatever it is cooked with.
