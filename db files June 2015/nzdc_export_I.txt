Quote: To build Britomart they need $91.5m from a body called Infrastructure Auckland (IA), formed when it was decided, uncharacteristically, not to give each Aucklander a share of the spoils from selling the city's assets, but to keep money to buy the little things that make life better, like transport. IA is meeting today to decide whether it will hand over the cash.

Theyare built on the square chine principle,with a good rise in floor forward ofamidships, which flattens out to a broadtuck stern. The original model was gunterrigged, but it was found.. the boatsperform better with a Bermudian rig.

Quote: The fish [snapper] caught on the long line are normally still alive when landed. Nowadays these are usually iki-spiked, a process of spiking the fish through the brain to kill it instantly. The iki-spiking splays the fins, accentuates the reddish colour and the individual blue spots, and, most important of all, delays the onset of rigor and so makes the flesh firmer. Unfortunately, most of this snapper goes to the lucrative Japanese market.

One repeatedly sees abundant crops of kale, maize &c., so treated standing alongside crops of the same kind grown in the same paddock but not intercultivated, and which in consequence have withered and died.

Quote: Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement. Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholdedwithout warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial  Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (I.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered.

Quote: Irishman scrub; Also called Wild Irishman, or Matagouri. A hard prickly scrub, almost leafless, which grows on almost any land and stands any amount of drought or frost. The early settlers always called it by its English names: but since the [1914-1918] war it is as often asnot called by its Maori one. It is very good firewood, and station cooks used it largely for baking  bread. Should its English names drop out of use they will be perpetuated in the names of many paddocks and flats; also in the name of Irishman['s] Creek Station.

In 1945, Lieutenant Winston McCarthy was seconded to the New Zealand Broadcasting Service to tour England and Europe with the Kiwi rugby team... It was during this tour [of the UK} that he developed is own distinctive call, "Listen for it... It's a goal". It became the catchcry that highlighted his commentaries; it was the quintessence of his style and personality... His legacy "Listen for it..." still remains vivid in the memory of all those who listened to him.

Quote: An iwi tax is a second mini-Treaty settlement (March 6). Any cost to commercial fishermen is naturally tax-deductible, thus lessening the tax take. Taxpayers will have to make this up in some other way.

Quote: Commercial users of the Waikato River should prepare themselves for an "iwi tax" after Ngai Tahu imposed a conservation levy on eel fishermen at Lake Ellesmere in the South Island. Mr Smith described the levy as the forerunner to a new nationwide iwi tax system after his group of eel fishermen were asked to contribute $29,000, or 8 per cent of the total annual eel fishery earnings of $360,000, to Ngai Tahu for Lake Ellesmere environmental restoration purposes. The iwi also receives revenue for leasing out its quota.
