Collins is similar, as is the definition in Freeland, <i>Architecture in Australia</i>, p. 317. If these (and Salmond) are accurate the NZ meaning appears to differ from the British and Australian.

7580	matrimonial property	1	1	1	That part of the property of husband and wife which is subject to division between them on the breakdown of the marriage, and may be divided on the insolvency of either, in contrast to <i>separate property</i>.	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes: This is defined negatively - that part of their property that is not matrimonial property (and is therefore not ordinarily subject to division). The content of matrimonial property is a matter of very complex definition, but broadly it comprises the matrimonial home, the family chattels and all property (including superannuation rights) acquired by either husband or wife after the marriage except by gift or inheritance. Its NZ legal use dates from the Matrimonial Property Act 1963, which took its name from a 1962 enactment in Victoria. Its present denotation was introduced by the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. The term matrimonial property exists in England but seems to be little used there. It is not recorded in NSOD, Collins or ODL, although ODL uses it in defining <i>community of assets</i>. The closest correesponding English term seems to be <i>family assets</i>, but this does not refer to a specific regime such as the NZ one. A broadly analogous regime to ours exists in many countries but it is generally known as <i>community property</i> or <i>community of assets</i>. The subspecies closest to the NZ system is known as <i>deferred community</i>. The item <i>separate property</i> is likewise not in NSOD, Collins or ODL. It is defined in the Oxford Companion to Law as a system of matrimonial property law under which each spouse continues to be the independent owner of his or her property. This differs from the NZ meaning. There are a number of subsidiary NZ terms, perhaps too technical for a general dictionary, eg <I>family chattels, homestead, occupation order</i>.	tdeverson		2/17/2010	2	1	0

She thinks it logically should mean something that cuts Solferinos, but Solferino was an 1859 Italian Battle and is also the colour of rosaniline, named after the battle, neither of which seems relevant to a kitchen applicance.	tdeverson		5/26/2010	2	1	0

8050	point	1	1	1		1	1	1			Jim says definitions in British dictionaries relate <i>point</i> to the  seacoast (headland, cape, promontory - "a high point jutting out into the sea"). NSOD gives as <i>chiefly US</i> "a tapering extremity of land etc.. constituting a geographical feature". This echoes the common use of point in NZ in <i>inland</i> placenames e.g. Arthur's Point, Awakino Point, Pleasant Point, Titoki Point, Ti-tree Point." I have not noticed any inland "Points" in England or in a cursory skim through British gazetteers. This use of the word may be worth followng up.	tdeverson		7/12/2007	2	1	0

It is interesting that there is no reference to this tree in Guthrie-Smith's <i>Tutira</i>. Its naturalisation at least in Hawke's Bay is thus likely to be later than 1939.	tdeverson		6/2/2009	2	1	0

1	1	1			The word was not common in New Zealand before WW2: the main term here was HOMIE. It probably originated in Australia, and possibly did not have quite the contemptuous edge that it had in Australia. Since WW2, the common term in NZ, with the corresponding obsolescence of HOMIE. PONGO, PONGOLIAN carry more contemptuous connotations. cf early use of Britisher contrast also colonial. Since WW2 correspondence columns often erupt in discussion of the origin of POMMY. The citations from Wellington's <i>Evening Post</i> and <i>Dominion</i>, and Christchurch's <i>Star-Sun</i> are typical of the discussion, and the main solution offered. probably `etym. dub.' is the most correct, certainly safest, `etymology'. Of the rest, Baker's suggestion of the connection with both JIMMYGRANT (attested) and POMEGRANATE (attested) seems most likely; or at least some shortening of pomegranate `new immigrant'.

1	3	1	also tailing muster 		(The word seems to have been introduced to Canterbury) Acland (1933) notes the following musters on high-country stations. -->So far as I know the usual ones are (beginning in the spring): <i>the cutting and tailing muster; shearing</i> muster; <i>straggle</i> muster (in the old days the shorn sheep were always turned not before the country .us;was straggled, <i>so that they would lead the woolies in); dipping or wearing </i>m.; <i>straggle </i>again; then <i>scratch</i> m. or <i>`lock-over' </i>to get the last of the sheep off the summer country before winter. This last is an undress sort of muster, the men catching what stragglers they can in the basins. There are always other partical musters of the flock; e.g., ewes to ram, or eye-slipping of hoggets.

It was quickly adapted (see 1840 entry) to include the white settlers and the civilised homeland they were preparing, a sense and use which obliterated the earlier.  Many uses (eg New Zealand Company (1839), New Zealand Gazette) were merely defining, and had, of themselves, no racial reference.

Possibly N.Zealand was the most frequent form (among many) until about the late 1840's; thence N.Z. became increasingly popular.	tdeverson		12/6/2006	18	1	0

verb is recorded from early in the 20 century mainly from Truth. -->The two senses probably have separate derivations: v1 `to support', `cheer for', from N.Irish (EDD) barrack, `to brag, be boastful of one's fighting powers': the example given from Antrim: ` `One boy will say of another `He's only barracking'. v2 `to chaff; attack with words' from an Aboriginal negative  barak; in Australia and New Zealand often found as borak, and  anglicised and folk-formed to borax (cf POKE BORAX). -->but cf the curious usage: -->1668(?) Dryden `A Defence of an Essay of Dr. P.' ed D. Nicol Smith 133 ... and that in some authors reserare was to shut as well  as to open, as the word barack, say the learned, is both to bless and curse. 	dhurley		11/26/2004	0	1	0

For example, Paraparaumu `beach' residents (once mainly a weekend population) refer to the original township on the main road as `The Village' and have done so since at least 1941; similarly for Johnsonville, originally a town, now a suburb of Wellington: their rugby supporters would call (c1950s) `Come on the village!'; the Taupo township (now near-city) was in the 1960s referred to by the large seasonal lakeside holiday population at least as Taupo village. -->The usage was probably fairly popular by at least 1940, and is now common, often being transferred to, for example, the `down-town' or shopping area of  a city by those living in the suburbs (e.g. `Are you coming into the village tonight to the pictures?'); or, specifically, of shopping areas, and now custom-built shopping-complexes in the suburbs (e.g. `You go up Karori Road past the first village, and just before you come to the second, turn off right ...'; or ``Marsden Village' is the name of the recently-opened shopping area in Karori.')	1	1	1				dhurley		2/15/2002	0	1	0

(phs influenced by the phrs in the cack, in the poop, of similar meaning: cf cack-handed `awkward').  Cactus was the code name of Guadalcanal which was a very rough and remote place to be during most of the war; therefore `up in the Cactus' had a particular aptness'. (?Were the code names given by US or British authorities.) (Cf cactus stove, and compare North African equivalent Benghasi burner.) There was some contact between men in the Islands and men in North Africa (cf coconut bombers). If `in the cactus' was revived (or even recoined) in the sense `remote place, boohai, could it not become associated with the other sense (2), and a similar sense of <i>boohai</i> `up the shoot ; awry ; askew ; in the shit'.	tdeverson		4/30/2010	2	1	0

In the more Maori districts the use would still have primary Maori meanings and associations, while in Otago, where there were few Maoris, the transference to purely European idiom be could completed much earlier. This transference was probably helped by rhyme with  loot (cf the ? mistaken interpretation of 1845 Barnicoat Journal 163. `Our first endeavour was to get a native as a guide over the hills `How much the loot' of course was the answer to our enquiries.') though op. cit 190`bargained for utu');  loot could have been an occasional joking word for money, although it is not attested in NZ until fairly recently but cf Partridge. Supp. Loot 3. `Scottish slang for moneyreceived on pay-day' Services: ca 1925;  anglicised as hoot, money, cash.

(The last usage perhaps illustrates the acceptance of the phrase in N.Z. idiom, when its literal meaning can be revived to counterpoint its traditional idiomatic use, in a kind of quasi-pun. A number of years ago, during a discussion of an English murderer's appeal to commute his death sentence, I recall someone remarking drily that the condemned man `had no show.

Mason notes: in Auckland Province narrow harbours or arms of harbours, mostly on the west coast are often called rivers, and were so named on older maps and in writings. They are in fact formed by the drowning of river systems. [nf in this sense OED, EDD, W3] -->On old maps: The Whangape River, The Herekino River, The Hokianga River; on present-day maps, The Waiuku River. At the present time [1957] the local inhabitants refer to the Hokianga Harbour as `the river', as do the people of Herekino to the Herekino harbour. Jane mander's novel  The Story of a New Zealand River refers to the Kaipara harbour, I understand. Various arms of kaipara and Hokianga are still named `rivers' on present maps.

4560	copper Maori	1	1	1	Copper Maori seems to have been used by Europeans in the North Island (esp. Northland) for the more usual hangi, umu. with <I>copper</I>. The Maori suffix (variously spelt in early texts) is curious. (1) It is used both with its flexionless Maori pl and its anglicised pl in -s. (2) If it is an aj, the placement after the noun follows Maori grammatical usage: a fuller anglicisation would be <I>Maori copper</I>, occas. used. (3) Williams (p?) states that <I>Maori aj and n `native, belonging to New Zealand' is a comparatively recent use not recorded before 1850, and probably first used by Maoris themselves. Is this an early Maori use of the modern sense of Maori? Or an early Pakeha use? (4) Or is it a use of the sense `normal, usual, ordinary' <I>- kopa Maori</I> being the usual earth-oven, perhaps distinct from the iron tripot etc., (then called in English `copper'), the <I>*kopa Pakeha; </I>	1	1	1	hangi, umu			tdeverson		2/13/2010	2	1	0

132	Native	1	12	1	Used within New Zealand, in competition with the more specific New Zealand, Maori to denote especially fauna (including human fauna) and flora considered indigenous. It is now (1984) anobsolescent or non-preferred use, chiefly because of the felt derogatory application to people and things Maori (cf the change in 1947 from Department of  `Native Affairs' to `Maori Affairs', and such shifts as native earth oven amended to earth oven between the sixth (1957) and  seventh (1971) editions of Williams Dictionary (Umu 1 p467); and also of greater feeling of identity  among born New Zealanders expressing itself in a more specific descriptive term `New Zealand'. (Shifts such as  native bush to indigenous forest are an example of vernacular or common as against technical or `professional' forestry usage: the  latter being the converse of exotic forest.)
The New Zealand non-specificity of native can be seen in its Australian applications (see Morris), and is illustrated by OED 13c. `In the names of Australian animals and birds in the names of Australian plants, fruits, etc.'  	1	1	1			J.A. Andersen's comments (`Popular Names of New Zealand Plants': 1926 Tr NZI 662) still hold: `The word `native' has been prefixed to almost as many names as the words `New Zealand .... This word may perhaps be descriptive if used within New Zealand and between New Zealanders; but if used outside - say in Australia - its meaning will be quite changed; for should the New Zealander speak of `native teak' the Australian would think not of a New Zealand but of an Australian tree. The confusion might be avoided were the word `Maori' used instead of the word `native', and indeed, instead of the long double `New Zealand'. See also 1933 Acland's note on indigenous.Usage is separated below into1. general and 2. specific applications. 1.

In the South Island one is often told:' Oh you're a North Islander are you?' Perhaps this is a reflexion of the parochial or `cinderella' spirit of the South Island which sees itself as being overcome in importance by the more populous and industrial North Island. ?a S.I. usage mainly

6214	lagoon	1	1	12	This common word has wide contextual usage in NZ - essentially a smallish, shallowish body of water - not necessarily or usually salt: indeed it can have salt (see x) or fresh (see y), muddy, or mineral, or clear; frozen or cold ( ) or boiling. It can be deep enough to drown in, or shallow enough to be merely an overloaded swamp ( ), or `sheet of water', or can even have no water ( ). It can be of some square miles (see Lake Grassmere) or small as a pond; early NZ uses follow this standard sense: get geog. as well as temporal coverage.

have I found any early Auckland ones, nothing before 1941 in Wellington. guess is that one or other or both of Jean Stevenson and Kathleen Montgomery started them in Auckland and through the YWCA spread them rapidly throughout the main centres.  	tdeverson		2/16/2010	2	1	0

Eric Partridge in his A Dictionary of Slang gives it as Australian colloquial from about 1910 - the date he thought he first remembered it from. I have it in my collections, but have no early date for it as I have not yet checked it up in advertisements of old newspapers, nor written to the company that produces it to ask them when they adopted  Nugget as a brand-name, and why. I assume it comes from nugget `a small lump', as in nugget of gold. Perhaps you or the class might like to write to the Nugget company and ask them about this. It's also now used as a verb - `to nugget shoes ', for example. It's like many other brand-names that have passed into common speech: e.g. hoover for `vacuum cleaner': to hoover a room, etc.

Many of the one-woman brothel keepers ran their front shops, as well as their prostitution trade, as regular business enterprises, selling merchandise as any other retailer would. The association between the legitimate frontage and the activity in the back rooms also reflected what Ann-Louise Shapiro has termed the 'polymorphous world of commerce and sexuality' which infused urban life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.	tdeverson		1/29/2007	2	1	0

I heard it casually from the lips of apparently respectable setters, as they rode on the highways, `Such and such a one is a good mark,' simply a person who pays his men their wages, without delays or draw-backs; a man to whom you may sell anything safely; for there are in the colony people who are regularly summoned before the magistrates by every servant they employ for wages. They seem to like to do everything publicly, legally, and so become notoriously not `good marks.''ca1941 He's OK. A good mark up to about 50 quidca1949 You're lucky to get him for the job.

3999	Native 	1	1	1	Applied to Maori people and their concerns.  a. The synonym Aborigine(q.v.) was used very early as a term familiar to the Colonial Office (and perhaps to missionary organisations as the Church Missionary Society) and had some currency from the offical name and office `Protector of Aborigines'. See also Cook's  (and early explorer's) indian.  b. native preceded Maori q.v. in common use in early journals and accounts. (eg Markham, Polack etc) the latter being first used (as perhaps native was) as an adjective, and its frequency was (until the 1850's or 1860's) matched only by the use of New Zealand and New Zealander (especially the latter as a noun) for `Maori'. -->[Discuss usage in eg. Markham, Williams, McLean etc.] In Richmond - Atkinson papers Maori seems to be the main personal usage of the correspondents except for H. Atkinson who uses negro, nigger in private correspondence. Abusive early synonyms: see black, nigger, later hori.

The Pilgrims looked with contemptuous eye on this people of strange aspect and impure blood, and did despise them. ... I awoke - and lo! the land which was to have been sacred to the orthodox foot only of a `body of English gentlemen', was in possession of the `stragglers, the whalers, and the stock-drivers from other settlements'. Alas! for the goodly land, - the land of the Canterbury Pilgrims.

14401	mongrel	1	1	1	1952 Feb 16 R.Gilberd notes on Mongrel Reading `Talking of Words' (Cecil Hull) p21`We might objectively and scientifically describe him, if he were ours, as a dog of mixed breeds - ... we would not be pleased if an acquaintance calls that dog a mongrel.'  In town where dogs are kept largely for appearance and display `mongrel' I think has only one meaning - that a dog is of mixed breeding (with a note of disapproval or contempt). In the country mongrel has two independent meanings.  (i) A dog of mixed blood. Objective - no emotional content. Indeed `pedigreed' is acquiring something of the mongrel taint, in that if a good dog has a pedigree it is mentioned with a faint note of surprise.  (ii) A `no-good' whether man or animal.  `He turned out mongrel' (Rod Macaulay speaking of a pedigreed mastiff that took to sheep worrying.)  `When Bill brought him home I knew he'd turn out a mongrel. Sort of a cow-y look about his head.' (Walter Hull discussing a pedigreed `Totara Park' Friesian bull which proved sterile.)  Talking of dogs:  An `eye-dog' is a specialised type of header which works very quietly, never taking its eyes off the sheep it is trying to pen. Sheep men generally seem to think the dog hypnotises the sheep into being penned quietly. I believe that the fixity of its gaze and its complete concentration enable it to detect and counter any rebelliousness on the part of the sheep before the sheep have quite made up their minds.

10240	ultimate	1	1	1	ultimate (frisbee) is a non-contact sport played by two seven player teams. The disc may only be moved by passing as the thrower is not allowed to take any steps. Any time a pass is incomplete, intercepted, knocked-down, or contacts an out-of-bounds area, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate change of possession of the disc. A goal is scored when a player successfully passes the disc to a teammate in the endzone which that team is attacking.	1	1	1			definition from Ultilingo.com (http://mypage.direct.ca/r/rulegal/all.html)	tdeverson		11/18/2006	2	1	0

7232	snow-apple	1	1	1		1	1	1			Kolstad says these are species of <i>Gaultheria</i> and snow-apple in this sense does not appear to occur elsewhere, only in OED2 and US Dictionaries as an apple cultivar. Kerry Carman writes (Sep. 2000): I can supply no other literary reference to snow apples but am sure Neave was referring to the Alpine Snowberry <i>Gaultheria depressa</i> or, more likely, the closely-related <i>G.d.</i> var <i>novae-zelandiae</i> (Mountain Snowberry) with pure white apple-shaped fruits.

7233	matchhead	1	1	1		1	1	1			Kolstad says there was an entry of "matchhead moss" <i> Cladonia cristatella</i>) written but not included in Vol.3 of Dictionary of American Regional English. Kerry Carman (Sep. 2000) writes : This is a very localised Southland/Otago colloquialism for the Grape Hyacinth <i>Muscari armeniacum</i>. The only literary reference I can give you, apart from Frame, is from Invercargill writer Olive Dunn's <i>Delights of Colour in a New Zealand Garden </I>p. 16. Other Southern writers such as Essie Summers also use the term I am told but I can not supply a reference. The origin remains a mystery but it may stem from the old blue topped wax Vesta matches. Dianne Bardsley says she knew the term well from the Wairarapa, but it is not known in Taranaki.	dhurley		9/28/2000	0	1	0

The phrase was common in the 1940s in NZ but was usually used in the figurative in the context of telling someone to take things steady - "Go easy or you'll bust your foofoo valve".

8703	check	1	13	1	to deposit property, especially luggage, for transport.	1	1	1			Jim writes Collins notes this as <i>chiefly US Can & NZ</i>. The OED definition refers to handing over an article for a check, inter alia to send it on to a destination. It has no extra-US citations for this particular sense. (The OED doesn't seem to have caught up with air travel). In relation to carriage of luggage by rail it has been in standard uses as a verb and attributively at least since the 1930s, predating its use in relation to air travel. Consult old NZR timetables? <i>Tranz Scenic Fares and Timetables 1997</i> refers to "checked luggage allowance". Probably standard NZE in relation to all modes of travel. [DEH: suggest NZ Railways Magazine as possible source of early cite].	tdeverson		11/25/2006	2	1	0
8705	club charter	1	1	1	a document authorising a club to sell liquor to its members, granted by the Minister of Internal Affairs (to 1948) and by the Licensing Control Commission (1948-89). 	1	1	1			Jim writes: Largely historical (1881-1989). Such clubs were known as <i>chartered clubs</i>. A special NZ application of <i>charter</i>, in that the charter did not constitute the club or give it a higher status but was no more and no less than a liquor licence. Now replaced by the <i>club licence</i> except for some old chartered clubs. Collins notes chartered club in this sense as <i>NZ</i>.	tdeverson		5/6/2010	2	1	0

"She's coming out this November". "<i>Come over</i>" is used in the same sense, but this is in NSOD. I have heard both expressions several times within the last year.	tdeverson		11/29/2006	2	1	0

9130	shellfish	1	1	1		1	1	1			An Australian lexicographer points out there is a difference between most dictionary definitions and what the public see as a shellfish; likewise in NZ the fishery regulations define for their convenience shellfish as including, from memory, crayfish, sponges and possibly even sea-grass. The sensible thing would be to redefine using as the basic definition the scientific one. The present OED definition is: Any animal living in water whose outer covering is a shell, whether testaceous, as an oyster, or crustaceous, as a crab. This wording is followed by Random House and Macquarie whereas the general public and scientists tend to think of a shellfish as a member of the class Mollusca, i.e. mostly animals with a hard calcareous shell or shells.	tdeverson		10/30/2007	2	1	0

8186	laundry	1	1	1	a room in a house used principally for washing and (since the advent of clothes dryers) drying clothes and linen. 	1	1	1			Jim writes : In relation to places this is much the most common use of the word in NZ. Not in DNZE or - in this sense - NZPOD but recognised in NZ Oxford Paperback. NSOD defines <i>laundry</i> as an establishment where clothes etc are laundered, Collins as a place where clothes and linen are washed and ironed, which encompasses the NZ use but is unspecified. In most modern houses in England clothes are washed in the kitchen and there is no separate room. In NZ until recently bylaws prohibited washing clothes in a room used for preparing food. <i>Laundry</i> is known in England in the NZ sense but seems uncommon. In a 1987 Property supplement to a Midlands newspaper it rarely appeared in the detailed house descriptions and always as an attributive - <i>laundry area, laundry room</i>. The term <i>laundry room</i> appears in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> 2000. The Australian situation (and word) was similar to the NZ one according to Hudson <i>Modern Australian usage</i>. MAU p223. Macquarie 1981 is consistent with this. Salmond
<i>Old NZ Houses</i>p. 200 suggests that the change of name from wash-house to laundry was associated with the advent of the bungalow style i.e. c1910-1920. Cf <i>porch</i>. But see <i>wash-house</i>. The same book implies (anachronistically?) a possible much earlier use  "Until the 1880s... water was heated... in the laundry copper for washing clothes and for the children's weekly bath." p. 143. Two house plans (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 198-99) are of interest. One dated 1930 has a "washhouse" under the same roof as the house; the other dated 1924 has a basement "laundry".	tdeverson		11/28/2006	2	1	0
8187	Marseille tile	1	1	1	a burnt-clay roofing tile, commonly used esp. on bungalows and State House. 	1	1	1			Jim writes: Introduced to NZ about 1901 and imported until 1924, after which they were made locally. See Salmond <i>Old NZ Houses</i> p 122 etc. An account of the development of the Marseilles tile roof in Australia is in Robin Boyd <i>Australia's Home</i> p. 151-153. Despite its European name and the original provenance of the tile, this term is not in British dictionaries I have seen. NSOD has only <i>Marseille ware</i> - a type of pottery produced in Marseilles during the 17th and 18th centuries. DEH adds: researching family geneology, I encountered a ship from Marseilles via Genoa to Sydney or NZ in 1909 from Marseille with a cargo of tiles.

8188	one-way	1	12	1		1	1	1			Jim writes : Dictionaries define <i>one-way</i> in relation to traffic as allowing travel in one direction only. This does not cover the common NZ one-way bridge, across which a vehicle may travel in either direction unless there is opposing traffic. That is, it can be crossed only one way at a time. Although the distinction is a fine one, it seems real. Possibly the term <i>one-way bridge</i> is itself distinctive NZE. The latest NZ Road Code uses the term <i>one-lane bridge</i>.			11/16/2000	0	1	0

7409	waka	1	1	1	a confederation of iwi	1	1	1			"Maori iwi are usually grouped into confederations, which are named after ancestral canoes (i.e.waka) which are said to have come from Hawaiki. The best known are Tainui and Arawa, but there are others (and I can't help noticing the recent term for Northland confederation is Tai Tokerau which is not a canoe). The use arises because traditionally a  Maori might have a number of iwi affiliations.  (I was once told that when asked their iwi in the Muruwhenua area, locals tend to look down at the ground and give the iwi in whose rohe they are standing, because they belong to all the Muriwhenua iwi). Thus the waka in the quotations [in <i>Kotare</i>]presumably refer to the notion of waka as confederations - which is not a bad way to think of political parties. And waka jumping is I take as heinous as announcing you are Arawa rather than the Tainui you once proclaimed (in the middle of a battle). (Brian Easton, 12/12/1999)	tdeverson		11/29/2006	2	1	0

These firms consolidated small lots of goods into wagon lot, thus creating "bulk" goods (from the Railways perspective) out of much smaller units. Their workers did not in fact "load bulk goods" - it was the result of their working that the goods became "bulk". Such firms still exist; their current formal name is "freight forwarders" although one hears bulk tonnage operatore or "BTO" occasionally. Examples include Mainfreight and Daily Freight... Given that the expanded name of "bulk tonnage operator" is some thirty years older than [your] example, I would be surprised if its contraction is not also somewhere recorded earlier than 1991.	dhurley		8/29/2000	0	1	0

I went to school 18m south of Hawera and we certainly called baby birds youngkies, although I might have spelt it "younkie."  We also called them "younks".	dhurley		8/29/2000	0	1	0
