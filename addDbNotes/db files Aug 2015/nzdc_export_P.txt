It is sold in crystalline form - like crack cocaine - and is 70%-80% pure... While powder speed is snorted, users heat P in the bottom of a glass pipe and inhale the smoke - a similar process to taking crack.

Quote: BARRACOUTA (MANGA) <i>Leionura atun dentatus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) INCREDIBLE as it may seem these fish, with their well-armed jaws of sharp fang-like teeth, were usually caught on a slightly curved stick about four feet in length. Fastened to this stick was a piece of stout fishing line about three to four feet in length, carrying a piece of red-coloured wood - usually cedar - about five to six inches in length. A bent nail was secured to this piece of wood in the form of a hook but no bait was used. When a school of Barracouta was found the Couta stick, or paw, was brought out ready for fishing. From the cockpit of the launch the piece of wood with the nail was violently swirled with a circular motion in and out of the water, causing a disturbance of the water in a good imitation of a number of Sprats, Pilchards or other small fish jumping in and out of the sea. The Barracouta would swim for such a place. Seeing the piece of red wood moving rapidly through the water they would take it for a fish, snap at it or even jump out of the water for the lure and were caught by the crude iron hook. As the fish was hooked during the time the paw was being drawn through the water the fisherman would swing the fish over his head above the boat or launch and when the caught fish was midway in the air, more or less above the cockpit, would expertly give the stick a dexterous smart twist. As there was no barb on the hook the fish was released and fell into the cockpit. <i>Ibid.</i> 311 Should there be any Barracouta about the... Couta sticks were then set to work to paw the water and attract Barracouta to the spot. <i>Ibid.</i>  314 The Maori also knew he could catch Barracouta without bait and he, too, used a short piece of stick and line with a baitless hook and leaned over his canoe and threshed the water to and fro, which is known as `Kaihau manga!' When the European fisherman called his fishing outfit [315] `paw', the Maori uses the term `pa'. This fish was a great favourite with them and was caught in large numbers. On returning to the shore, the women cleaned the fish and then hung them up on racks to dry in the sun. Old Maoris of Opotiki told me they used a chip of Tawhai (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>), which is dark red, in the making of a pa (paw).

Quote: Food and gear have to be carried. Everyone in New Zealand, almost everyone anyway, puts it in a <i>pack</i>, but probably no one stops to think that the word <i>pack</i> in this sense is not standard English. ... England since 1895 has borrowed <i>rucksack</i> from German dialect; New Zealand has preferred <i>pack</i>. Not that rucsac is not used here; it is noticeable that older Club members used it in several articles in early numbers of <i>Tararua</i>, and it still appears in advertisements. <i>Rucksack</i> seems a bit foreign, as is shown by the less correct but more foreign-looking spelling it is usually given. <i>Pack</i> as a synonym for <i>rucksack</i> is used in Australia to some extent at any rate. This sense of <i>pack</i> would most likely be in use long before it occurred in print. I remember having a home-made <i>pack</i> in Auckland in 1933.

This is where up to 5 days pasture feed will be allocated in one hit (often meaning one complete paddock) with any hay or silage allocated usually being fed out in progressively larger amounts in the last 2-3 days. In minimising stress the paddock grazing was clearly superior.

Quote:  ... We met a small party of [440] mounted natives, who brought news that an apostle of the new <i>Pai Marire,</i> or <i>Te Hau,</i> fanaticism had arrived at Taupo ... They are called <i>Pai Marire</i>, from the words which they subscribe to their signatures and use in greeting or parting from their co-religionists. The words literally mean `good! be appeased'; but the real tendency of the belief is to unite the Kingites of all sects in one common bond of fanatical hostility to the pakehas. <i>Te Hau </i>means only the <i>hau </i>(faith). <i>Ibid</i> 466 ... a host of perverts were chanting <i>Pai Marire </i>hymns round a <i>Hau-hau</i> post of worship, erected close to the late Christian church.

Quote: <I>Pai Marire </I>- `The Good and Peaceful', also known as `Hauhauism' - was a syncretic religion originated by the prophet Te Ua Haumene, of the Taranaki tribe, in 1862. It had messianic and millenarian aspects, and theologically combined traditional Maori religion and the Maori versions of Christianity with Te Ua's own innovations. ... The original form of Pai Marire may have died out as early as 1866, with the death of its founder, but related or similar cults developed around leaders such as Hakaraia, Te Whiti O Rongomai, Titokowaru, Te Kooti, and Tawhiao himself.

The word <i>pakeha</i> serves them to signify all whites, whom they also call `Iouropi' (Europeans). I did not observe that they had a special name for the English.

The people on the beach, somewhat nonplussed, I expect, needed a name to identify the new arrivals. They chose "pakeha".... These days it is used in government documents, even though there is confusion over just who is Pakeha: are Pacific Islanders Pakeha? Or Malaysian Chinese immigrants? Or Sudanese refugees?... I do not want to be identified as Pakeha, a colonial term that should have died out when the colonial century ended.

Quote: Adventurers, whalers and sealers, Pakeha Maori were European men and women who came ashore in New Zealand in the early 19th century and took their chances among the local Maori. Much more than the Europeans who arrived after 1840, the Pakeha Maori were integrated into tribes and depended on Maori for their livelihood and survival.

Quote: Maori is a very beautiful language; and English is not a bad one as languages go; but that delightful 'patois' called Pakeha-Maori, which is the vulgar tongue among half-castes, loafers, missionaries, Maori doctors, and other kinds of vagabonds in the North Island, goes beyond either of its component roots for breadth of expressions, and euphony of sound. In Maori again no two consonants occur together, so that in using English words in Pakeha-Maori, a vowel must always be stuck in between consonants where they happen to meet.

It does not necessarily signify `a plain'. The `a' is sounded long and broad in this word, by which it is distinguished from `pakihi,' to be low water, or to drain off as a river after a flood, in which the `a' has a sound both short and soft. `Kua pakihi te wai o Waitaki,' the water of Waitahi has become low.

Quote: ...why is a boss in New Zealand sometimes referred to as a pannikin? I can't pin down the answer to this one. A pannikin is a small drinking vessel used by workers. The expression "pannikin boss" was first recorded in 1911, in the <i>Maoriland Worker</i>: The 'pannikin' boss ... is the man who for a wretched shilling a day more than his fellow unionists sells his body to a mercenary employer to rush, wear and sweat others."

Quote: Keith Snalam of Blenheim writes: "As an apprentice boy in the 50s, I frequently heard the term 'pannikin boss'. I'm sure it was used as a comment on the state of mind of the foreman or leading hand, that person having just had the big boss from the office on his hammer ... The foreman would be seen approaching the workers in a state which these days would be described as stressed out. Hence the term, 'here comes the panickin' boss'!"  Maybe. Dave Bijoux of Mt Eden suggests: "The pannikin boss drank from the pannikin, as did all the workers: a boss who metaphorically drank from their cup, was part of the community, and was somewhat despised as a prostitute for the workers. Ronald Thomas of Pamlerston North adds: "Perhaps there is a connection between a metal cup that holds a little liquid and a trumped-up boss who holds little authority, but makes a lot of noise about it."

Quote: Papakainga - `homeground' does not reveal the spiritual and emotional connotations this word implies. Papakainga is that area where one's original kinship group came from and lived. Whether or not the area has buildings on it, it has strong emotional overtones for any Maori. In this age of the urban Maori, the ability to refer to ancestral areas - the place where one's own history was made - is a matter of deep pride. Once known, one can never leave it - though one may be physically absent all one's life.

This protection was called puru and the sandals were then known as tupuru." Patiti was also regarded as "a fine thing to put in the paraerae to keep the feet warm and if one was wading it was warmer with patiti around the feet than without it."

Altogether this bird is a most remarkable one: clothed in feathers of deep black from head to foot, he wears a most grave and sacerdotal aspect. This is not all: he bears out closer the clerical resemblance by the possession of two pure white feathers under his chin, and the parody is complete when he commences to utter his guttural yet energetic notes. Sitting on the branch of a tree as a pro tempoire [????] pulpit, he wags his paw [????] and shakes his head, bending to one side, and then to another; as if he remarked to this one and to that one ... etc

The parts of each which met will be left behind by both the retreating bodies, and will probably remain where the collision occurred. But, owing to the way it has been struck off, the two sides being impelled in opposite directions, it cannot help revolving, and it is not unlikely that nearly all the thousands of rotating bodies and systems in the universe may have thus been set spinning by partial impact. At partial impact, rotation must ensue. The matter will tend to spread out more or less in a flare, with frequently gas at the poles and the middle body produced by the collision will generally be very hot, proportional to the mass.

They have been bombarded with tens of thousands of papers and pamphlets.  Diagrams showing the third body have been broadcasted before them by thousands and by hundreds.  A new term - "Partial Impact" - was specially coined to express the idea for their benefit and guidance.  But there they sit in their specialized turrets, regardless; and this prime idea, that the parts struck from grazing suns are welded into a third body, has failed to impress them.

Quote: As the mine workings reached greater depths the ground generally became more solid and stable and more and more shrinkage stopes were worked, until this method became the principal one in use for stopes up to about forty feet in width. The method consisted of putting in the level timbers in the usual way, with short chutes or `passes' installed every other set to allow all the ore in the stope to be lowered evenly as it was worked. <i>Ibid.</I> 209 ... including ... chutes for ore-handling, or `passes' as they were generally known. <i>Ibid.</I> 315 <i>Chutes or passes</i>: Chutes for running the broken ore out of the stopes into the hand-trucks were, for shrinkage stopes, placed between alternate sets (about 10 ft centres). They were about three feet wide, mounted three inches above the truck, and fitted with top and bottom doors. The bottom door was removed and the flow of ore into the truck controlled by jambing a pass-bar across the chute. (This was a short bar about three feet long with a D-shaped handle). The bottom of the chute was inclined at about 50 degrees from horizontal. For filled stopes, the chute was installed at the bottoms of the cribbed ore passes, leading up through the filling to the face of the stope; the ore passes were usually spaced from 18 to 25 ft apart along the stope, this being a convenient distance for men to shovel the ore. <i>Ibid.</I> 329 <i>Passes:</i> See chutes.

(British road atlases use the term <i>passing place</i>. For a time recently there were <i>passing bays</i> on the Rimutaka Hill road). The corresponding Australian term, at least in Victoria, is <i>overtaking lane</i> (Personal observation).

So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.' The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ... [12] Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `runholder' was the most used, and it is the word that I think should be substituted.

Wellington Provincial Council let a contract for a slip in Evans Bay in 1868 but wrangling between the council and contractor stalled progress and the job was completed by the Wellington Patent Slip Company in 1873.

The word is applied by the Maoris to all weapons, and also, with a qualifying adjective, to pounders and beaters of flax, fern-root, etc. The early explorers, e.g. Cook, restricted the term to weapons of the <i>mere</i> type, and, as a generic term for this group of weapons is useful - in fact necessary - the usage, though not strictly a Maori one, has been followed by modern ethnographers.

These white-skinned beings of the imagination were also known as pakepakeha and pakehakeha. These words are the direct antecedents of the word Pakeha. There is nothing pejorative about this derivation of the meaning and use of the word Pakeha to denote the white strangers who came to these shores in the 18th century.

Notes: Note on conversation with Deidre Macken (60 yrs) about her mother's story (86 yrs). She was in the Wellington Ballet Company in 1926 and on news of Pavlova's tour wrote to her manager enquiring how they could help make her tour and reception more pleasant, her favourite colours, foods, etc. She expressed a great liking for meringue (cakes) so they consulted a chef who produced 3 attempts (e.g. a square cake was rejected in favour of a round one); finally the `soft-centre' variety was chosen. In her honour they named it Pavlova (?cake) and they presented this to Pavlova (? at a gathering) and she liked it a great deal. D. Macken is to research this - ? Ballet company records, etc. Deidre Macken (04) 384-6073 -  H.D. Macken, Nairn St.

Quote: The Editor,The DominionPavlova - Name and NatureSir, -- In spite of silly claims regularly surfacing especially in Australia (Dominion 2/2/99), the facts of the development of the confections and the date the name `pavlova'  was applied to them have been reasonably well known for some years now. They may be found in the Dictionary of NZ English (1997), the Australian National Dictionary (1988), and the writings of Professor Helen Leach of Otago University.The name `pavlova' post-dated the ballerina Pavlova's Australasian tour of 1926, and was first applied in New Zealand by the Davis Gelatine Company in 1927 to a jelly dessert whose moulded multicoloured shape may have suggested a tutu. It was next (in 1929) applied independently (and only  in NZ) as `pavlova cake' or `sponge' or `meringue' to the previously well known so-called `meringue cake' or `sponge'. The recipe change to the legendary pavlova icon is usually reputed in NZ to be the addition of vinegar to give the soft centre, and in Australia, the trademark of passionfruit in the topping. (The name `pavlova' does not occur in either the Futter book (1926) or the Terrace Tested Recipes (1927) mentioned in your report.)The elliptical simple form `pavlova' for the meringue is recorded earliest in Australia from 1940 (so AND, two of whose quotations acknowledge NZ as the originator) and in NZ from 1953 (DNZE).There is no evidence that the name `pavlova' was applied in Australia before 1940.  Both countries share the earliest recorded date 1966 (and the same quotation) for the abbreviation `pav'.The New Zealand Dictionary Centre at Victoria University (Box 600, Wellington) would be glad of any pre-datings of any of the above, with author, title, date, and page references.Harry Orsman
Notes: Check date of publication. "Terrace Tested Recipes collected by the Ladies of Terrace Congregational Church" was published by Whitcombe & Tombs in 1927 (191 pp). There were three editions in 1927; the first is held by Turnbull, the 3rd was held by Te Papa (Hector Library) but recent report (HO) says they no longer have it.

Quote: Contrary to what they'll tell you in Perth, Western Australia, Bert Sache, a chef at the Esplanade Hotel did not invent the pavlova. All he did, in 1935, was to make a meringue and cream cake that he said was "light as Pavlova", the Russian ballet dancer who six years earlier had stayed at the hotel. but the name stuck and thus was born the myth about its origins. The truth is that the large meringue with the marshmallow centre - the heart of the pavlova - was common in New Zealand in the early 1930s, even earlier. In 1927, for instance, there was a recipe for a meringue cake submitted by a Mrs McRae in the second edition of <i>Terrace Tested Recipes</i>, collected by the ladies of the Terrace Congregational Church in Wellington.

Quote: Pavlova is more than a national dish, it is an institution. ... Sweet, airy and laden with calories, the cake was named after Anna Pavlova who visited New Zealand in 1926. ... It is worth mentioning here that the Australians claim to have invented the pavlova, and insist that it was created in honour of Pavlova by a Melbourne woman in 1926. New Zealanders, however, might answer that in the same year a pavlova recipe appeared in a book entitled <i>Home Cookery for New Zealand </i>(although it went under the name of `Meringue with Fruit Filling') and that another recipe actually called `Pavlova' was published the following year. Certainly the classic kiwkfruit (Chinese gooseberry) topping which the Australians have also adopted must belong to New Zealand.

I don't think we'll ever discover who had the original idea which transformed a hard oversweet dessert into the delicious dessert of today. I was at University in Dunedin from 1928 to 1932, and well remember my mother making pavlova during the summer holidays - the latest popular recipe from a fellow-member of the local Croquet Club - probably 1928-1929. I remember how carefully she watched over the oven and then turned it onto a plate - almost holding her breath.

Notes: The most widely known game with insects is a game named variously by T.C. students as Butcher Boys (Gisborne, New Plymouth, Kaponga, [405] Te Pohu, Newall, Sth. Wellington), Butcher Bats (Ohau, Takaka), Penny Doctor Beetles (Tauranga, Pipiriki, Rotorua), or Fishing (Morunui). It is a game in which straws which have been suitably moistened with spittle are placed in an insects [sic] hole and are flicked out when the insect bites the end of the straw. Most of the reports of this practice come from the North Island, though it was known in the South as early as 1900 (Waikouaiti).

In this game straws moistened by spittle are pushed down the hole of the appropriate beetle. The beetle seizes the end of the straw. When the player feels the straw moving he or she flicks out the beetle. The player who can catch the most beetles wins the game.

This literally means the far reaches of the main urban transport route through a city or town which used to cost one penny in the gold [sic] old days. Once you've reached the end of the penny section, you are heading for the suburbs. However, the expression is also used colloquially to mean the end of the easy stuff or the end of the golden weather. Once you're out of th penny section, you have to pay more, or, in this sense, work a bit harder.

The children had not seen pepes as big as them before and they used to sit  up a little afraid in bed... But after a while they got used to the knockings of the pepes against their windows at night.

Quote: Stray notes on Australia and the Diggings (Griffiths Collection) Origin of the word `Nugget'. - This word, now so common amongst our population, is a strange sounding word, and destitute of any apparent entymological meaning. It originated at the Ophir diggings in New South Wales, and is probably a corruption of `ingot', which is itself a corruption of `lingot', a little tongue. The wedge of gold which Achan purloined is called, in the original Hebrew, a `tongue' of gold, as a reference to a Bible with marginal readings will show. In California, the word `lump' is generally used, and sometimes the Spanish word `pepite.'

Quote: The use of perch as a square measure in New Zealand - one fortieth of a rood - may be noted.   NSOD gives this as 'rare, except historical'.   It became historical here only in 1968 with the advent of metrication, and was until then anything but rare. The area of every piece of land that could not be expressed simply in acres or roods was described in perches. The word occurred in thousands of land titles, and was used to define the size of any section smaller than the quarter-acre 'norm'. Perch as a linear measure on the other hand (as in NZPOD) I have never seen outside the backs of school exercise books!

Quote: 1980 saw the introduction of a new stratigraphic parameter, the Percy.  No longer do geologists illustrate the scale of the outcrop photographs with such mundane objects as hammer, lens caps, 2 cent pieces and bananas.  If in the forefront of geological technique they now take as an essential item of field equipment, Percy Strong.  Such is Percy’s usefulness as a unit of stratigraphic thickness, and so great is the magnetism of his image on screen, that one lecturer introduced his choicest slide with the pronouncement “that’s Percy”, and only then proceeded to describe the rocks.  It is understood that Cathy, with callous disregard for the visual effect on her husband’s figure, is knitting for Percy a cap-a-pie jumpsuit with 100 horizontal stripes so that thin-bedded sequences may be measured in centi-Percies (cPe); and further that Percy himself now steers clear of field trips in areas of steeply-dipping strata, to avoid the necessity of being photographed in a horizontal position in stream beds.

A total of 125 officers have been granted medical disengagement on the grounds they are no longer able to carry out police work. Several have then taken up similar investigative work in the private sector. The medical option is colloquially known within the police as `perfing out', based on the acronym of the scheme's original name - police employment rehabilitation fund.

Quote: It is most commonly called peripatus - from the same Greek root as <i>peripatetic</i>, meaning itinerant or wandering... The animal is also called the velvet worm or walking worm - references to two of its more obvious traits. Peripatus are found largely in the southern hemisphere - in Australasia, south-east Asia, Africa and Central and South America. <i>Ibid.</i> 66 I have to roll my peripatus onto its back again to view the circular, lobe-lipped mouth with double pair of sickle-shaped mandibles, and the two lumpy "gun turrets" - oral papillae - used to such effect in the capture and consumption of prey. Both the jaws and oral papillae, as well as the antennae, are pairs of modified limbs. Peripatus are opportunistic and will scavenge in preference to expending energy on hunting. <i>Ibid.</i> 74 Peripatus may boast a lineage more ancient than that of New Zealand's other, more famous, "living fossil," the tuatara. Early marine animals, such as this 500-million-year-old fossil from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, appear remarkably similar to living onycophorans... <i>P. novaezealandiae</i> females.. have been found to carry embryos at all stages of development at all times of year, and to give birth regardless of the season, albiet more abundantly in summer.

This is a true periwinkle, but that name is frequently applied locally to other shellfish, some of the top-shells and the cat's-eye.

And for the name, you can be forgiven if you call our imported possum (the `brushtail possum,' to be precise) an opossum. The Aussie possum - there are about six types across the Tasman - looked so much like the American counterpart when first discovered by Europeans that it was called an opossum. As recently as 1981, scientists who turned up for the first New Zealand symposium on marsupials ... were sagely talking about possums in 12 of the papers presented while their colleagues talked about opossums in six papers. All were referring to the same nocturnal nuisance. One of the great achievements of that symposium was to finish up talking the same language after taking a vote that favoured for possum. ... The fur trade is pushing for `NZ phalanger' (a generic name for a group of marsupials) while possum stew exporters are trying to win acceptance for `Kiwi bear' in Oriental restaurants.

However, in traditional New Zealand preserving, the word pickle is usually reserved for preserves in which the pieces of fruit or vegetable remain separate, most obviously in onions and gherkins, but also in chow chow and picalilli in which the vegetables are preserved in a thickened mustard sauce.

Quote: <i>Pick-up boat </i>- The boat used for picking-up whales killed by whale-chasers. The pick-up boat would then tow the whales to the whaling station for processing. Sometimes, if the mother ship was not available for pick-up work, a spare chaser or the one with the least work on hand would take on the task of picking up.

Quote: <i>Picnic, n.</i> Besides the ordinary meaning of this word, there is a slang Australian use denoting an awkward adventure, an unpleasant experience, a troublesome job. In America the slang `an easy or agreeable thing.' (`Standard.') The Australasian use is an ironical inversion of this. -->1896. Modern: -->`If a man's horse is awkward and gives him trouble, he will say, `I had a picnic with that horse,' and so of any misadventure or disagreeable experience in travelling. So also of a troublesome business or other affair; a nursemaid, for instance, will say, `I had a nice picnic with Miss Nora's hair.'' [Check: omit ?]

Quote: Meanwhile the `pickers up' were busy gathering up the fleeces as they fell from the bereft sheep and carrying them to the sorting table, where they [173] were stripped of the `pieces', which were thrown aside, while the best of the fleece was quickly classified, rolled together, and deposited in a kind of bin, according to its quality, whether `clothing' or `combing.'

The former is common throughout Newzealand; the latter is common in the South Island but rather rare in the North and is thought to be a mutant of the former. Both names were applied to both birds by the Maori, but for distinction pi[i]wakawaka for the pied and ti[i]wakawaka for the black have been adopted by the Pakeha. The bird is noted for the disaster it caused to Maui in his struggle with the mother of night, Hine-nui-te-po, Death personified.

Quote: Pierce's Disease, the latest outbreak of agricultural pestilence to rattle the West, is relentlessly tearing through Californian vineyards, worrying winemakers around the world, not least in Australia and New Zealand, for whom California's wine culture has long been a source of inspiration and grapevines... Pierce's Disease is caused by <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, a bacteria that lives in the xylem of plants, the thin layer beneath the surface that transports water and nutrients from the roots.

Quote: No map the collector has consulted has shown Pigroot Hill or hotel, and yet it is the most prominent and most used name between Palmerston and Kyeburn. Again and again the collector has heard the remark, `I am going into the Central by the Pigroot,' or `I came down by the Pigroot.' So frequently is it used that one might imagine that certain people used it thinking that the word `root' is in reality `route,' but be that as it may, common usage is the deciding factor in place-names, and Pigroot, with its associations back into the fifties, has come to stay. The name was originally [9] bestowed because the wild pigs rooted up the hillside looking for the roots of the taramea, or speargrass, which they enjoy eating, and which is probably one of the main reasons why speargrass is so rare nowadays.

Quote: .. In a farming context it is usually a sugarbag made into an extemporised rucksack with some rope or a strip of flaxleaf. It can also be a chaff-sack, closed at both ends, and one side slit across at the centre and used with this side uppermost. Thrown across, either under or over the saddle, the two large saddlebags thus formed could be used to bring home some wool plucked from a dead sheep, or as a sheltered place to carry a weakling lamb.

Quote: Protestant natives regard their Roman Catholic brethren as belonging to the devils: they are called pikipo, which M. Pompalier explained as being derived from <i>episcopus</i>, which seems to me the most probable derivation. The Protestant missionaries however, say that it means piki-po - always bowing [370] - (piki, bend - po, night). The Protestants, therefore, call their bishop pihopa, while the Roman Catholics have retained the title pikipo for theirs.

The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.

The following was written in reply:] `Dream of Shagroon' [title] I saw men of another aspect arrive at the pilgrim-land. ... The Pilgrims looked with contemptuous eye on this people of strange aspect and impure blood, and did despise them. ... I awoke - and lo! the land which was to have been sacred to the orthodox foot only of a `body of English gentlemen', was in possession of the `stragglers, the whalers, and the stock-drivers from other settlements'. Alas! for the goodly land, - the land of the Canterbury Pilgrims.

These epithets, already forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; and the origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation.

Quote: Pin dips were also another popular amusement. `A pin or a bull or a button, To see a rary rary show show show!' (1875; Tahataki). A piece of glass backed by cardboard was covered with a piece of paper that could be flicked up to show the `rary rary show' or had a slit in it through which one could peep. One saw through the glass a variety of colors, pieces of colored paper, flower petals, pictures, and later pieces off cigarette boxes. Sometimes these had been arranged in some pattern, at other times they were kaleidoscopic only, and the perceiver had himself to add the configurations of intelligibility. The price for the view was always a pin `which we did not want anyhow but always accepted,' a relic from an age when such things were rare. Pin dips were known also as `poppy shows' (perhaps it was the similar flash of color that gave the same name - `the poppy show' - to the exciting experience of seeing a girl's dress blown upward by the wind; pins were not charged for flowers of this sort). In fact, the pin dip or the prick book may have developed from the poppy show. The poppy show was common before 1900 and the prick book after that date, a fact connected with the ever-increasing stock of picture cards and magazine pictures available to children.

The really good ones were eight inches long and two-and-a-half inches in diameter. They were wrenched out in the same way as giggies. These `pineapples' were never very much sought after by the general public. They needed what might be called an acquired taste. They were tricky eating too. You bit off all the outside hard, nobbly but not prickly covering, and then gnawed the soft, sweet flesh to the bone.

Quote:  From the leaves of the rimu Cook brewed `spruce beer', and the black-pine [matai] furnishes a beverage known to bushmen as `pine-beer'. The tree containing beer may usually be known by a black, smutty-looking stain that extends some way up the trunk; and if a hole be bored at the base the tree may be plugged and tapped like a barrel.

Some of the `old guard' didn't bother. They prefer to work off ranks. One of Auckland's better-known taxi drivers is a pirate -- `Waverley' Bill Claney -- so named because he used to hunt the old Waverley hotel rank. These days he's known by a new generation as `Kojak' --he declined an interview saying: `I'll be in touch when I want to write my memoirs'. Here's hoping Bill.

Quote: The common <i>Acaena</i> was called by the Maoris Piri-piri, but colonists frequently [usually] corrupt the Maori name, and call the plant Bidi-bidi. As a general rule, the Maori names are more incorrectly pronounced as we go southward from Auckland to Otago. This is largely due to the fact that, in the north, Europeans have been brought into closer contact with the Maoris than in the south. In some few cases, the difference in pronunciation may be due to differences in the Maori dialects. The changes that take place often follow phonetic laws - thus the Maori `p' is softened into the European `b' as above, while `r' is replaced by `l' or `d'. Poro-poro (<i>Solanum aviculare</i>) becomes Bulli-bulli, and Puriri becomes Boradi. This also explains such a form as `Kowdie' pine for Kauri pine. Korari - a flax-stalk - similarly becomes Koradi or even Kaladi [1907 edn ?mistakenly, <i>Kalladi</i>]. `K' is also sometimes altered into `g,' this Kie-kie (<i>Freycinetia Banksii</i>) becomes ghi-ghi. The last vowel in a reduplicated syllable was faintly pronounced in Maori, and often disappears altogether in the European form of the word, <i>e.g.</i>, Poro-poro gives Bulli-bull, and Piri-piri gives Bidi-bid.

Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.

Quote: Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, [sic] chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II[roman] brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.

Lots of quick short words to fit in the breathless pauses as you pant uphill. `Crud' (cloud), `bush-bash', a `gunn' tramper (which must have originated from Davy Gunn's famous trek up the Hollyford Valley to help victims of a plane crash in 1936; he travelled 40 km by rowing boat, horse and foot in 21 hours), `windfall' (a collapsed pile of trees), `pit' (the tramper's true friend, a sleeping bag), `pog' (porridge), `bastard grass' and `lawyer' (two unpleasant plants), `piker' (one who stayed home), `Huey' (all-powerful god of weather), and many, many more.

Dad's mate used to go into the pit and dad, who was the taller, stood on top of the log. Dad had to drive the saw downwards, and his mate pulled it, and up and down they sawed, squared the log, cut boards and four by two and so on until they had  sufficient timber for rafters, uprights and floor joists.

This fringe hung down the bare thighs, and as the wearer moved the gentle click-click of the hard tubes made a sound that was liked as to the frou-frou of a silk dress.

The former is common throughout Newzealand; the latter is common in the South Island but rather rare in the North and is thought to be a mutant of the former. Both names were applied to both birds by the Maori, but for distinction pi[i]wakawaka for the pied and ti[i]wakawaka for the black have been adopted by the Pakeha. The bird is noted for the disaster it caused to Maui in his struggle with the mother of night, Hine-nui-te-po, Death personified.

Quote: PLANTAIN (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i>) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass'. From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie"-that is `Charles and George"- a souvenir of 1745.

Quote: PLANTAIN (<I> Plantago lanceolata</i> ) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass'. From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie"-that is `Charles and George"- a souvenir of 1745.

Quote: `Bah!' you say, `the play way'. Wait a bit, my friends. Reflect on what your children of five here learnt by the play way before they ever went to school. [17] What is the `play-way'? Is it universally practised in schools today? The term `play-way' is well known to students of education as the name given by Caldwell Cooke to a highly successful experiment, mainly in the teaching of English, carried out by him at the Perse School, Cambridge - a fee-paying school, with a high staffing rate and a tradition of experimentation.

Quote: [Hdg] Plimmer's Ark back from the dead. A new chapter in the eventful saga of the <i>Inconstant</i> - the ship that became a building - has started following the recent opening of the new Plimmer's Ark Gallery on Queens Wharf... For many years life in Wellington basically revolved around the hulk of the <i>Inconstant</i>... Built in 1847 and launched on 3 Jan 1848 at Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, the <i>Inconstant</i> sailed to England and there had her hull clad with copper...On entering Wellington Harbour [in 1849] the ship ran on to the rocky beach between Pencarrow and the point now named Inconstant Point. The <i>Inconstant</i> was towed across the harbour to Te Aro. John Plimmer bought the by then derelict ship and had it moved in 1850 to Lambton Beach where he built a pitched roof over the mid section. It became known as Noah's [<i>sic</i>] Ark because of its appearance.

Quote: Plimmer's Ark is one of the most significant pieces of maritime history entrusted to the Maritime Archaeological Association. In 1977, construction workers digging in the old Bank of New Zealand building on Wellington's Lambton Quay discovered a slab of wood. Archaeologists identified it as part of the <i>Inconstant</i>, a ship that was towed into Wellington and was eventually bought by John Plimmer who dragged it ashore and modified it for use as business premises. The ship became known as Plimmer's Ark.

[Blacksmiths] set up their smithies and began making implements more suitable for the terrain. One of the first of [the New Zealand made ploughs] was a long sleek job known as a swing plough. Just why is hard to say ... The furrows were the result of the accuracy of the ploughman's eye, as it had no wheels whatever. The depth was graduated by the bridle adjustment but was corrected in uneven ground by leverage from the long handles, or stilts as they were called. If the the share struck anything these [swing ploughs] had a kick like a run cow. It is said that a good man could land on his feet six yards in front of the horses ... The next development was the lever plough which ran on three wheels and had no handles except a stubby one at the back.

It got middle class married women out of the home and into the public sphere where they could contribute meaningfully and it no longer serves that function"... Now women no longer have to channel their energies into voluntary organisations, such as Plunket to find a niche in the public world. <i.Ibid.</i> C7 She began with the view which arose out of 1970s feminism, that Plunket had been a foce that dictated to women and kept them in their place.

Quote: The pod is a hydrodynamically designed handboard which fastens with a velcro strap to the palm of the hand and when used while bodysurfing provides propulsion, lift and control... The pod.. is not new, just refined. It has been around for a while now, with the Taylor's Mistake handboard being popular among surf lifesavers in New Zealand as far back as the 1970s.

In some places these holes made by(?) cattle mustering a most hazardous undertaking. In Mr Alex Garvie's report in 1858 he refers to `podge holes,' presumably a variety of `crab-holes.'

Quote: Pohutukawa are our remarkable trees - the symbol of New Zealand, as the oak is the emblem of England. Like the oak, the pohutukawa has a short, stout gnarled trunk that becomes beautifully gnarled with time, the wide-spreading branches forming a most stately and memorable tree... The name "pohutukawa" comes from "hutukawa" (a head-dress of red feathers) and "po" which has meany meanings, including night or underworld. Governor Grey interpreted this as meaning "the tree with red adornment near the sea", but "po" could equally be a reference to the traditional tree at Cape Reinga where the spirits of the dead descend via the pohutukawa tree to a secret cave, the entrance to Te Reinga, the spirit or underworld [sic]. A small, scrubby version still clings to the cliff edge at the leaping-off place of the spirits. In Maori, to say someone "has slid down the pohutukawa root" is a lyrical way of saying he has joined the ancestors.

Notes: Jim says definitions in British dictionaries relate <i>point</i> to the  seacoast (headland, cape, promontory - "a high point jutting out into the sea"). NSOD gives as <i>chiefly US</i> "a tapering extremity of land etc.. constituting a geographical feature". This echoes the common use of point in NZ in <i>inland</i> placenames e.g. Arthur's Point, Awakino Point, Pleasant Point, Titoki Point, Ti-tree Point." I have not noticed any inland "Points" in England or in a cursory skim through British gazetteers. This use of the word may be worth followng up.

Quote: The documentary <i>Pokarekare Ana: A Maori Love Song</i>.. on the origins of the song, surrounds the contributions made by Sir Apirana Ngata and Paraire Tomoana with a misleading element of mystery... For a number of reasons, "Pokarekare" is unlikely tobeen the original work of either of these men. (1) "Pokarekare" was published in sheet music form in 1926 (twice), in 1927, 1936 and 1940 prior to Paraire Tomoana's death in 1946. The two 1926 versions are said to have been arranged by "Hemi Piripata" and "Alfred Hill": respectively. the 1927 version is said to have been arranged by "P H Tomoana and Archie Don". The 1936 version is said to have been "collected and sung by Ernest McKinley" and the 1940 version is again said to have ben arranged by "Hemi Piripata". in short, no published version of the song, including the 1919 booklet entry, gave any credit to either Apirana Ngata or to P H Tomoana for composing the song in their lifetimes... The most likely conclusion would seem to be that what has affectionately become "New Zealand's unofficial anthem" originated in the far north of New Zealand  circa 1900 and was adapted. modified and developed in its journey through the country by a number of gifted Maori composers of the day.

Quote: ...Tomoana explains the song's origin: "7. Pakarekare. These ditties emanated in the North of Auckland and were popularised in Narrowneck Camp, and eventually drifted to ... the East Cape. There they took the present form ... and acquired close association with the last drafts of single men from the East Cape and Wairoa districts ... the 19th and 20th Maori Reinforcements."

Quote: In 1978 I went with a Hamilton Teachers College kapa haka student group on a tour of Aboriginal settlements in Australia's Northern Territory... The group refused to include "Pokarekare Ana" in their repertoire because in their eyes the song had become a parody of the original, with "squashed banana" lyrics... At the Adelaide Festival, Rolf Harris asked us to accompany him in his latest hit, "Pokarekare Ana."... Anyone from Dame Kiri Te Kanawa down can sing "Pokarekare". It adds to the popular culture of New Zealand.

Notes: Jim Cameron writes : See Electoral Act 1993 s. 155. The British equivalent is <i>polling station</i>>. Popularly a polling place is often referred to as a <i>polling booth</i>, which has the distinct legal meaning of a room within a polling place. For each polling booth the Returning Officer for the electorate appoints a <i>deputy returning officer (DRO)</i>. The corresponding perrson in Britain appears to be known as a <i>presiding officer</i>.

It agreed expressions such as "Pommy bastards" and "whingeing Poms" were terms of abuse. Authority chairman Sam Maling noted the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's ruling that the words "Pom" and "Pommy" were unlikely to offend of insult.

The term is of Australian origin, of a period long ago when the military and other authorities of the time called the men of the penal settlements, `Prisoners of Mother England', which was shortened to P.O.M.E. and later made `Pommie'. The New Zealand term was `Homie' until superseded by the Australian adjective. And even now Pommie is being superseded by the term `Pongo'. The term certainly was derisive in origin, and as to whether it is still derisive depends entirely upon the individual addressed as such.

Quote: A Tasmanian gave the origin definitely as being `pomegranate', the colour of that fruit being similar to the high colour of the complexions of the English, and very noticeable against the sun-dried appearance of the Aussie complexion. This has been acceptable to many knowing the Aussies' susceptibility to using phrases such as `plates of meat' for feet and `trouble for strife' for wife. Pommy to many has become a most objectionable word owing to the way it has been used with other words. Only the most ignorant use of such terms, not thinking that their forefathers came from that same brave country. If my comrades of the Homeland, newly arrived, who use the nom-de-plume, or refer to themselves as `Pommies', read this they will now understand why it is objectionable even when used in a friendly manner.

Quote:  Sir, -A correspondent wishes to know the origin of the word `Pommie.' The famous war correspondent, the late Ashmad Barlett, in his book, `Despatches from the Dardanelles,' written at the time of the campaign, says that the term `Pommie' was applied by veteran troops of the campaign to newly arrived troops from Britain. Their fresh pink complexions were likened to the fruit pomegranate, in contrast to the bronzed features of the veteran troops. They were referred to as `Pommies.' The term, therefore, was not applied by Dominion troops in particular to those from Britain, but by veteran troops, both British and Dominion, to new arrivals. -KIWI.

Quote: Sir, - In reply to O.J. Davis and `Very Interested' relating to the origin of the word `Pommie.' The word apparently came into being during the 1914-18 War and is derived from the French word pommes, meaning, I believe, potatoes. During the war the front line troops of the British Army were very seriously short of food, except for potatoes, on which they subsisted for many weeks. Hence on the fields at Flanders this peculiar and, I might say, very controversial word came into being. I am sure that any British World War I veteran could affirm this explanation.-W.J.BRACKS.

Immigrants were variously termed-Immygrant', `Jimmy grants', and up among the bananalanders, quite often `Pommy grants' (pomegranates).

Was he one of them or was he still, if you scratched below the surface, just another Pommy? Certainly he never exchanged his Worcestershire accent for the very individual New Zealand version of our language.

Quote: Two women, a cook and a nurse, were gaoled for three months in Wallasey, England, recently for "communicating" with German prisoners. The two "tarts" used to sneak out and "communicate" with the 'orrid 'Uns under cover of darkness. Food is certainly not the only shortage in Pommie-land nowadays, as far as the womenfolk are concerned, at any rate. Nor, it is fairly evident, are all the ministering angels as noble-hearted as was Nurse Cavell.

The name `Pommy' is strongly resented by immigrants after they have been resident in Australia a few weeks, yet they are entirely to blame if the name sticks. Some of the newcomers will not drop their `pommy-ism' and they assume a silly air of `superiority', even going to the extent of trying to keep ex-Imperial sevice men in a sort of private organisaion. ... What is written of Australia might well apply with R.S.A. substituted for R.S.S.I.L.

Quote: [Corresp. col.] Sir, - It is to be regretted that the artist who labelled his picture `Punga with Parasites,' did not write `Tree fern with Parasites,' as punga does not mean tree fern, or anything like it. Bushmen usually called a pukatea, buckyteer; a kowhai, goey; and a kaponga, [variant of ponga] a bunger whence comes the word punga, both a noun and a verb in Maori. The kaponga or brown tree fern is not nearly so handsome as the mamaku, or black tree fern [Cyathea medullaris], the latter often being a chief's prerogative for the white heart in the middle of the young leaves, which was baked and eaten.

Quote: ...Tom says I am a sheeler for playing Poor Jenny ... My spelling cannot have improved much with the years for I had to look up the dictionary to find whether one spelt the word `sheila' or `sheilagh'. Of course `Poor Jenny' or `Poor Sally', as it is perhaps better known, was and no doubt still is a girl's game. As I had three doting sisters I cheerfully joined their games when my boy friends were not looking. Remember the words of the song? Poor Sally is a-weeping, a-weeping, a-weeping, Poor Sally is a-weeping, On a bright summer's day. On the carpet she shall kneel While the grass grows in the field - Stand up, stand up, upon your feet, And choose the one you love so sweet. Then followed `the moment of truth' and with girl and boy standing demurely in the middle of the ring of children, the circle danced around them singing: Now you're married I wish you joy, First a girl and then a boy. I forget the final words, if any. Usually this game was followed by `Ring-a-ring a rosie, Pop down a posie.' Strange, though, how the love-making aspect would come into many of these old games. I must have been a pronounced `sheeler' about this time because I also remember joining in the singing of I sent a letter to my love And on the way I dropped it, Some of you have picked it up And put it in your pocket. Dropped it - dropped it! And so on. A year or two later at the mellowing age of 10 years I abhorred all these `sissy' games though I still had a hankering to play `Oranges and Lemons', even at the great age of 12.

Quote: In the early 'eighties occurred two dry seasons during which grass fires were run over the hot western and northern faces of certain portions on eastern Tutira; on the blackened ground then and once again seedlings of brome-grass (<i>Bromus mollis</i>) appeared in so great profusion that other grasses were temporarily submerged in hillsides of waving hay. [284] `Poor Pretences' was then the name by which this brome-grass was known on the east coast : it may be worth putting on record a suggestion as to how the plant came by such a curious designation. It was a `poor pretence' compared with ryegrass, cock's-foot, and white clover, the mixture sown then almost as a religious duty on Hawke's Bay runs, good and bad alike. So much for the sense; as regards the sound, `poor pretences' can, I think, only be a corruption of <i>Poa pratensis</i>; the Latin name of the one plant done into English has been fitted to another. The reader will recollect how this grass - more widely known as goose-grass - was sown wholesale over the trough of the run.

Quote: Finally, beware of the big purple poozle person (to poozle is to snaffle; to take).Things do go missing if left lying around – that includes tools, resources, equipment, materials and artwork. Put things away, be conscious of what you’re using and where it comes from. If something disappears whilst you’re using it, let the tutor know. And don’t poozle other people’s stuff without asking, or the original owner might forget to look after you and may break some furniture in their effort to get at you.

Quote: My old friend Kae Miller used to drive a gaily decorated van with "A Pride of Poozlers" inscribed on the side. My son Jonathan, who has driven that van, believes it was around in the early 1770. I am sure it was some time in the 70s. I have the impression, perhaps wrongly, that Kae invented the words poozle, poozling and poozler. Jonathan has the same belief but neither of us is sure if it is correct. She certainly used these words. Kae (single name Katrine Hursthouse), was a dedicated environmentalist,long before it was fashionable. Poozling was a part of her environmentalism. She poozled (I think she would have resisted the word "scavenge") diligently in the old Wilton tip and claimed to have rescued valuable antiques.

Quote: It was not until considerably later that the `swing type' stoper with its pneumatic-feed-leg for drilling uppers, and known as the `popper', came into use. In it the drill was rotated in the hole by swinging the machine handle backwards and forwards. At first the miners did not like it, as they considered it `shook up' the roof too much, causing falls of ground, but it was light and easily transportable and was fast in good ground. It remained in use in the stopes for many years, until the much later introduction of the rotary stoper. At one stage the popper was given the rather undeserved name of the `widow-maker'.

Quote: Pin dips were also another popular amusement. `A pin or a bull or a button, To see a rary rary show show show!' (1875; Tahataki). A piece of glass backed by cardboard was covered with a piece of paper that could be flicked up to show the `rary rary show' or had a slit in it through which one could peep. One saw through the glass a variety of colors, pieces of colored paper, flower petals, pictures, and later pieces off cigarette boxes. Sometimes these had been arranged in some pattern, at other times they were kaleidoscopic only, and the perceiver had himself to add the configurations of intelligibility. The price for the view was always a pin `which we did not want anyhow but always accepted,' a relic from an age when such things were rare. Pin dips were known also as `poppy shows' (perhaps it was the similar flash of color that gave the same name - `the poppy show' - to the exciting experience of seeing a girl's dress blown upward by the wind; pins were not charged for flowers of this sort). In fact, the pin dip or the prick book may have developed from the poppy show. The poppy show was common before 1900 and the prick book after that date, a fact connected with the ever-increasing stock of picture cards and magazine pictures available to children.

Notes: Jim writes: The question is whether the <i>British</i> use of porch is also wider than the dictionaries suggest. The absence of the terms sunporch etc from these dictionaries may be significant. I have noticed two (apparently) wider uses in Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Tolkien p.246 - "Now they had time simply to sit and talk especially on summer evenings after supper, on a bench in the front pocrch of Sandfield Road." [This is interesting for the author's phrase <i>in the porch</i>, whereas we would normally say <i>on the porch</i>. Also in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> p. 213. A 1987 Midlands Property Supplement has porch only in the sense of entrance porch (and then seldom); one or two ads have the term <i>storm porch</i> which was new to me. (Although porch and verandah are partly interchangeable, I think that the covered entrance to a meeting house - whare tipuna, wharenui - is always in English "porch", although it extends for the full width of the building.)

Quote: The depredations of the subterranean grass caterpillar [<i>Oxycanus</i> sp.] in the rye-grass and clover pastures, particularly in ... the east coast of the South Island, have been recognized for some years as demanding control measures. The damage ... is probably only second in importance to that done by the true `grass grub,' <i>Odontria zealandica</i>. Until recently, practically all damage done to pasture was attributed to <i>Odontria</i>, [310] and only recently have farmers commenced to distinguish between the two pests, and to refer to<i> [Oxycanus]</i> as `grass caterpillar,' or`<i>Porina </i>caterpillar.' It is unfortunate that the generic name <i>Porina</i>, which was coming into general use, must now be changed to <i>Oxycanus</i>, since the name <i>Porina</i> is preoccupied as a molluscan genus.

Quote: Terms such as `moo-cow' and `baa-lamb' were not encountered once [among Maori schoolchildren]. In the light of this, it is interesting to note the common form `pork' or `Porky' for `pig'. This occurs several times and in contexts which would not lead one to suspect baby talk of any kind; <i>We just about got some pork.</i> This usage refers not to the meat, but to the living animals, and against this usage the form `pig' occurs only once. <i>Ibid</i> 105 <i>Please, it's a porky.

It is quickly growing colonising plant, reaching a height of three metres (ideal for native bush revegetation sites) and grows on the edge of coastal and lowland forests and along road edges and clearings.  ... Reputedly having a mild acidic taste similar to the cape gooseberry, poroporo was cultivated and eaten by Maori and early European colonists who made jam from it.

Quote:  `I believe that the member for Tarawera is referring to the possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), not opossums (genus Didelphis) which are American marsupials,' [Agriculture Minister Moyle] said in his written reply. ... And for the name, you can be forgiven if you call our imported possum (the `brushtail possum,' to be precise) an opossum. The Aussie possum - there are about six types across the Tasman - looked so much like the American counterpart when first discovered by Europeans that it was called an opossum. As recently as 1981, scientists who turned up for the first New Zealand symposium on marsupials ... were sagely talking about possums in 12 of the papers presented while their colleagues talked about opossums in six papers. All were referring to the same nocturnal nuisance. One of the great achievements of that symposium was to finish up talking the same language after taking a vote that favoured for possum. ... The fur trade is pushing for `NZ phalanger' (a generic name for a group of marsupials) while possum stew exporters are trying to win acceptance for `Kiwi bear' in Oriental restaurants.

Quote: Sir, - According to a recent report in `The Dominion' the Chief Postmaster at Wellington is reported to have used the term `posties' in referring to certain of his staff of postmen and postwomen. This is a slang term, derogatory and discourteous, like the term `cop' for police officer, `cockie' for farmer, and `rag' for newspapers. He should be asked to apologize to these diligent people who work on Saturdays when most other workers enjoy this day off duty, and when speaking about his staff should in future refer to them by thier correct and proper designation, postmen and postwomen.

Their puzzled expressions were quite understandable to anyone living south of Cook Strait.

The word is probably a contraction for Pu-pu-moa.

Quote: Home in Waikato, Tawhiao sought solutions to Maori problems through the establishment of Maori institutions to deal with them. In 1885 he initiated the institution of Poukai, where the King would pay annual visits to King movement marae to encourage people to return to their home marae at least once a year. The first Poukai (originally called Puna-kai, or 'source of food') was held at Whatiwhatihoe in March 1885. It was a day for the less fortunate to be fed and entertained. The Poukai developed into an event which would later ensure direct consultation of the people with the King.

Quote: KOKOHINAU Marae in Te Teko had the honour of hosting, for the first time in the Mataatua area, the Maori King, Tuheitia on Sunday.... Mr Eruera said the king was attending a poukai, or assembly, and this was the 44th year it had been held at Kokohinau. ...  A copy of a publication celebrating the 44 years of the poukai being held at Kokohinau was also given to the king by Katerina Waiari. Teriaki Amoamo, on behalf of Whakatohea and Te Whanau-a-Apanui, presented a ceremonial hoe waka (canoe paddle).Mr Eruera said the open debate session, which is what a poukai is all about, raised a few issues. One of those issues was brought up earlier in the day by Whakatohea and Te Whanau-a-Apanui who requested to share the poukai in the future. Mr Eruera said the request would have to go to hapu members to consider.A restored flagpole was also erected – hapu members, under the direction of carver Graham Junior Niao, carried out the restoration on the carved pole – and the special poukai flag was flown.

A hole is drilled in the end of it, and the egg must have been considered of great value by the natives, as it was found deposited at the head of a skeleton, with a number of very large poenamu axes.

If only we'd been animals the RSPCA and all the animal lovers would have caused a public outcry - but we were only humans so no one worried. There had been no reason for punishing me - the official reason given was that I was put there as an assistant cleaner. The cleaner already there had virtually nothing to do. So the whole deal was hell of an unusual - in fact no crim I met had ever before heard of a situation in which an inmate who'd committed no offence had been sent to the pound - especially as an assistant cleaner.

There was slots, there was lumps, there was packing fragies in bottlos, there was the tying down of the north line for a clearance, the scissors, lead seals and squeezers. The sorters on call-back flicking circulars with precision. The volcanoes of letters on the facing-up table, the checker chanting the reds onto the lorry, the checker calling the overseas in, London 45 ... The queue of men working at the parcel depot or the postal siding ... Tieing down the cargon. ... The sorters' school at the posties' pub known colloquially as Box 44 or the B.B.C., the Back Bar of the Cecil. The cheerful abuse of cobbers.

Quote: In the constitutional debates of 1854 during the first session of the New Zealand Parliament, the term `Prime Minister' was frequently used in a somewhat casual fashion. This explains in part why it was some years before the term `Premier' came into general usage. William Fox (q.v.) who took office in July 1861, was described in the <I>Gazette</I> as Attorney-General `with first seat in the Ministry'. In November 1864 Weld (q.v.) was gazetted as holding `a seat in the Executive Council and the office of Premier'. Stafford (q.v.) his successor, in October 1865 was termed `First Minister'. In June 1869, when Fox again headed a Ministry, he was described officially as `Premier and member of the Executive Council.' Thereafter the term `Premier' was regularly used. Nevertheless, in the Schedule of the Civil List Act of 1873, provision was made for the salary of the Leader of the Government `being the Prime Minister'. The first Premier to use the title `Prime Minister' officially was Richard John Seddon (q.v.). It was used in the <I>New Zealand Year Book</I> of 1900 and the Imperial Conference of 1903 confirmed the practice.

Definition:At directly this etym. comment: [OED2 6c dial and US 1851 `shortly' applies generally in NZ rather than 6 a. `immediately'. Compare the use ofpresently.] The following is moved from the DIRECTLY entry for check at PRESENTLY: presently. In NZ presently usually means `in a short while' (as OED 4), but I have heard it used occas. as immediately (OED 4). At <i>presently</i> 4, OED notes `In blunted sense (gradually weakened from 3): ... soon, shortly. (cf ANON 5, BY and BY 4, and colloq use of <i>directly, immediately,</i> and nearly all advbs of the same kind.) Now the ordinary use.'; W3]

The former refers to pressing the fleeces into tight-packed bales ... to facilitate the transport of an otherwise bulky commodity. The latter is the process of keeping the floor (the `boards'), on which the sheep are shorn, clear of loose ends of wool, dirt and excrement.

Quote: Pressing. - When there is sufficient wool in one bin, the pressers (generally two) get to work. One gets into the `box' as the lower portion of the patent presses is called, while his mate ... hands him ... the fleeces. These are placed in tiers, and tramped down until the lower box is full. An upper box is then swung ... or [16] lowered on to the lower one, and the process repeated. When full, the `monkey' or cover is put into position, the spears (wire rope) affixed, and the two men lever the cover down until the top box is clear.

Quote: Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.

Quote: Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, [sic] chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II[roman] brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.

Notes: Jim Cameron writes : This replaced the previous sentence of <i>reformative detention</i> (1910) and <i>declaration as habitual offender</I> and <i>habitual criminal</i> (1906). None of these terms is recorded in DNZE. Its scope has been protean. In its present form (Criminal Justice Act 1985 as amended) it is a sentence of indefinite detention with no fixed maximum that may be imposed on persons aged 21 or more convicted of certain sexual and other serious offences. A sentence under the same name existed in England from 1908 to 1967.

Quote: Fr Delaney said: "I did not know till recently that trout fishers are accustomed to take a priest with them when they go for a catch. They take a wooden mallet or other weapon with them and use it for the last rites when the fish is in its final struggle. And the mallet is called a priest.Nor did I know, until a book of angling, 1880, told me, that an all-purpose fisherman's fly called a priest is likely to make a good catch."

THE term `Prime Minister' was first used in New Zealand during a constitutional debate in New Zealand's first Parliament in 1854, and was subsequently used on many occasions during the late 19th century. In 1873, for example, in a schedule to the civil list, provision was made for the leader of the Government `being the Prime Minister.' The title `Prime Minister' was adopted officially in 1899 and Richard John Seddon was the first New Zealand Premier to use it. It was officially used in the New Zealand Year Book in 1900 and in Parliamentary debates in 1902.

In the years that followed [the establishment of the meat and Dairy Boards] producer boards were set up to oversee the production and export of fruit, honey, poultry and hops. After the [second world]war producer boards were re-established and extended to include wool, eggs, kauri gum, maize, barley, potatoes, bobby calves, pork, apples, berry and citrus fruits, tobacco, and as recently as 1988, kiwifruit (q.v.).

During the first year of the Settlement, Canterbury was invaded by a body of sheep-farmers from Port Philip (Victoria) who were regarded by the settlers partly with admiration as successful Colonists, and partly with horror as disbelievers in the art of colonisation and the `Canterbury System'. The visitors found the country admirably adapted for sheep-farming, and they treated with some contempt the raw emigrants from England who looked to agriculture as the foundation of their fortunes. One of the visitors, who seem to have delighted in the soubriquet of `Shagroon', ventured to prophesy, in a letter, which found its way into print, that the `Canterbury Pilgrims' would soon be ruined and their country left for occupation by his more enlightened comrades. The `pilgrims' sought no harsher revenge than to nickname their Port Philip visitors `prophets' and to take example from their experience in pastoral pursuits. The Canterbury pasturage system was quickly adapted to the requirements of sheepfarming on a large scale, and `pilgrims' and `prophets' were soon merged into one class of Canterbury runholders.

Quote: Not only did Australian sheep arrive, but during the 1850-60 period many Australian squatters (disgruntled by the fickle rainfall) also sold or abandoned their properties and migrated to New Zealand. These men arrived with capital to invest, with experience in colonial farming, knowledgeable of the peculiar habits of the Merino sheep, and with whole-hearted support of a `squatting' policy of land tenure based on the occupation of large areas of grazing country at low rentals. They became known as the `Prophets' because they forecast failure for the small-area arable farm plans of the established settlements.

The Province of New Ulster shall comprise the whole of the island hitherto called the Island of New Ulster, with the exception of those parts of the said island adjacent to Cook's Straits, which the Governor-in-Chief of New Zealand may, by any such proclamation as aforesaid, except and exclude from the province of New Ulster.

The former aimed at the incorporation of the provincial governments, with a view to their ultimate absorption, and maintained the right of the General Assembly to intermeddle in all provincial affairs. The latter, on the other hand, insisted that the Imperial Parliament had established two independent governments in New Zealand, each for its own sphere, the provinces having exclusive jurisdiction in all provincial matters, and only under the control of the General Assembly on matters of general concern.

Quote: Some of the lads made their [sun-dried] bricks in what they called a pug ring, formed by driving the horses round in a circle as with the old-time chaffcutter, but Cecil made his on what they called a straight. A strip of ground about 30 yards long by four or five wide was scooped free of top soil, which was dumped on the garden nearby. It was then ploughed about ten inches deep, or according to the number of bricks required, and very well watered, which was usually done with a shovel from a tank on a sledge for even distribution, and left to soak all night. A good layer of chopped-up tussocks was then evenly spread over the top. After more watering a six-horse team was driven up and down the strip until the pug was well mixed.

The original Maori puha was rauroroa or S. kirkii - a ntive which has a whitish bloom on the leaf surfaces and is usually found near the coast... Puha leaves were put on cuts and wounds to prevent infection, and waipuha, or water in which puha had been boiled, was drunk to cure stomach complains and loss of appetite.

Ngawhas [is] a term specially used for non-intermittent springs, for the solfataras and sulphurous hot-springs on the Rotomahana, Rotorua, and Rotoiti.

They said, `He rau pukapuka tenei!' `Oh! this is a leaf of the Pukapuka.' The Greeks derived their [<I>biblos</I>] book, and the Latins their <I>Liber,</I> book, in a similar way, from the inner bark of the Linden or Teil tree, and the Egyptians theirs from the leaf of the Papyrus, whence comes our word paper.

Quote: The pukatuola is another wonderful animal of the southward [sc. Otago], told of by the old men. Under a different name he is heard of in the north. A gigantic animal of the lizard species, most dangerous to humanity. A very shrewd man, whom we met to the southward, was of opinion that these hairy men and crocodiles had their origin in the Maories seeing pictures of animals in books belonging to Europeans, and then persuading themselves that they existed in their woods: but I cannot take this view of the case.

Swamp hen it is generally called in Westland, but I have heard it also called bald pate and New Zealand Turkey.

Quote: [The Maori implement's] genuineness has been questioned, one sceptic asserting that it was neither more nor less than a British marlinspike; but the carving was of Native pattern, and the pointed portion, instead of being conical as is common in European, was also characteristically Maori in type ... The late Archdeacon Williams had told him it was called an ahao, and he found that another name was purupuru. Only recently, through the assistance of Mr. Percy Smith and the knowledge of some old-time Maoris at New Plymouth, had he found its purpose. It was really a marlinspike used for the caulking of sea-going canoes, and having a like end in view, the Maori had developed an implement almost exactly resembling that of the Europeans.

Quote: Mention of the above term in 1890 reminds me of another side of Christchurch in those days - namely the gangs, or `pushes' as they were called - of larrikins. They wore bell-bottomed trousers, fancy shoes and well-oiled forelocks. These young ruffians frequently assaulted any lone pedestrian who happened to come their way.

Quote: <i>Push, n.</I>  gang. The word is of late, very common in Australia. It was once a prison term. Barrere and Leland quote from M. Davitt's `Leaves from a Prison Diary,' `the upper ten push.' In thieves' English it is (I) a crowd; (2) an association for a particular robbery. In Australia, its use began with the larrikins (q.v.), and spread, until now it often means clique, set, party, and even jocularly so far as `the Government House Push.' [1890]

Notes: possibly from racing or bookmaking referring to the putting up or publishing the weights to be carried by horses so that punters can read the facts for themselves; or perhaps, from raising the handicap weights carried so making things more difficult both for the horse and for the bettor who fancies it: perhaps (though very unlikely) from a general analogy of tipping the balance, making the true weight (or, metaphorically, character) of somebody known, as one finds out a true weight literally when one `tips' old-fashioned scales by raising the weights and the thing to be weighed off the surface into a weighing position; ca1952 June Wellington I'll put his weights up with his cobbers tomorrow about his flirting.

In the Urewera country it is called <i>Kai-weta</i> (i.e., weta food). [That ugly innocent the weta (<i>Deinacrida</i>) has thus been accused of perforating the tree; but as a matter of fact though often used as convenient residences [195] by the weta, the holes are made by the caterpillar of the large moth <i>Hepialus virescens</i>... ].

In his opening speech to the Council he justified this action, or rather rode roughshod over any objections to it. `Now,' he said, `I would have Mr. Cutten and all others to know that I am in no degree to be swayed from doing what I have a right to do - to put the right man into the right place - whether that man happens to be my son-in-law or any one else' - a mode of speech now known amongst politicians as `putting on hobnailed boots.'
