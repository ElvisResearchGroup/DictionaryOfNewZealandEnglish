Quote: Simulium ? Namu, or sand-fly. Polack, New Zeal., p.319. ... To some insect, of a genus allied to Simulium, is to be referred the New Zealand sand-fly alluded to in the following passage:-  `A sort of little crane-flies (tipula alis incumbentibus) became remarkably troublesome during the bad weather. They were numerous in the skirts of the woods, not half so large as gnats or musketoes, and our sailors called them sand-flies. Their sting was extremely painful. . . . All, however, were not equally affected.' Forster, Voyage, ., pp. 135, 136. `The most mischievous animals (at Dusky Bay) are the small black sand-flies, which are very numerous, and so troublesome, that they exceed everything of the kind I ever met with: wherever they bite they cause a swelling ...' Cook, Voyage in Resolution and Adventure, i., p.99.

Quote: It's the story of a little boy whose brief encounters with a powerful grandmother create a sense of "Napierness" ("a compound of sterling silver serviette rings, the damask of napkins - or rather serviettes - and of EPNS cake forks, nestling in velvet"), as good an explanation as any for why that rough little seaport took a Hollywood-esque role in a Wells documentary about art deco... The book closes with reconciliations with parents and with place. Napierness lives on, for "the past is always in the present, and, if it doesn't visibly exist, can be re-invented on the basis of the tiniest piece of existence".

Quote: It may be remarked that National Park is American in origin, dating from 1872, about the time  that Yosemite was set aside for recreational purposes. In England, park, like forest, may have a definite legal meaning when it applies to a tract of land held by royal grant for keeping beasts of the chase. Unlike a forest, a park is enclosed, and [31] it does not have special laws or offices. In all the uses to which park has been put in England, until the recent adoption of National Park, there has been the idea of enclosure, as there is in the cognate paddock. The term forest park, as in the Tararua Forest Park, would once have seemed a contradiction in terms.

Definition:Used within New Zealand, in competition with the more specific New Zealand, Maori to denote especially fauna (including human fauna) and flora considered indigenous. It is now (1984) anobsolescent or non-preferred use, chiefly because of the felt derogatory application to people and things Maori (cf the change in 1947 from Department of  `Native Affairs' to `Maori Affairs', and such shifts as native earth oven amended to earth oven between the sixth (1957) and  seventh (1971) editions of Williams Dictionary (Umu 1 p467); and also of greater feeling of identity  among born New Zealanders expressing itself in a more specific descriptive term `New Zealand'. (Shifts such as  native bush to indigenous forest are an example of vernacular or common as against technical or `professional' forestry usage: the  latter being the converse of exotic forest.)  The New Zealand non-specificity of native can be seen in its Australian applications (see Morris), and is illustrated by OED 13c. `In the names of Australian animals and birds in the names of Australian plants, fruits, etc.'

Notes:J.A. Andersen's comments (`Popular Names of New Zealand Plants': 1926 Tr NZI 662) still hold: `The word `native' has been prefixed to almost as many names as the words `New Zealand .... This word may perhaps be descriptive if used within New Zealand and between New Zealanders; but if used outside - say in Australia - its meaning will be quite changed; for should the New Zealander speak of `native teak' the Australian would think not of a New Zealand but of an Australian tree. The confusion might be avoided were the word `Maori' used instead of the word `native', and indeed, instead of the long double `New Zealand'. See also 1933 Acland's note on indigenous.   Usage is separated below into 1. general and 2. specific applications. 1.

The members of the `Australian Natives' Association' (A.N.A.), founded April 27, 1871, pride themselves on being Australian-born and not immigrants. Mr. Rudyard Kipling, in the `Times' of Nov. 1895, Published a poem called `The Native-Born,' sc. born in the British Empire, but outside Great Britain. As applied to Plants, Animals, Names, etc., the word Nativebears its original sense, as in `Native Cabbage,' `Native Bear,' `Native name for,' etc., though in the last case it is now considered more correct to say in Australia `aboriginal name for,' and in New Zealand `Maori name for.'

Definition:Applied to Maori people and their concerns.  a. The synonym Aborigine(q.v.) was used very early as a term familiar to the Colonial Office (and perhaps to missionary organisations as the Church Missionary Society) and had some currency from the offical name and office `Protector of Aborigines'. See also Cook's  (and early explorer's) indian.  b. native preceded Maori q.v. in common use in early journals and accounts. (eg Markham, Polack etc) the latter being first used (as perhaps native was) as an adjective, and its frequency was (until the 1850's or 1860's) matched only by the use of New Zealand and New Zealander (especially the latter as a noun) for `Maori'. -->[Discuss usage in eg. Markham, Williams, McLean etc.] In Richmond - Atkinson papers Maori seems to be the main personal usage of the correspondents except for H. Atkinson who uses negro, nigger in private correspondence. Abusive early synonyms: see black, nigger, later hori.

Quote: [cp Maori] Many Maoris resent the fact that they are called `natives' by the pakehas. Joking among themselves, they may call each other natives, but the use of the word in this connection becomes a joke just because of the resentment at its use by the pakeha. One informant expressed the matter thus: `We're not natives, we're Maori. A native is an aborigine, a savage, while we are three or more generations away from that. We don't like having a Native Department, or Native schools, or a Native Land Court, or a Native Minister. We like to be called Maori. We're proud of being Maori, not natives.'

Quote: Temple rightly notes Dieffenbach's enlightened perception of the Maori as the first inhabitants with fundamental rights, and not inferior, intellectually and morally, to the invading European. But he labours the point in seeing evidence of this in Dieffenbach's reference to them as `New Zealanders, by implication the true inhabitants of the country, when the terms Maori and Native were become synonymous and implied that they were inferior to the intellectual and moral superiority of white, especially British, races'. At the time, `New Zealanders' was commonly used (eg  The New Zealanders Illustrated by G F Angas, 1847) while the term `native', meaning `native to the place' without the depressed sense it was later to acquire, was also used freely by Dieffenbach.

Quote:  Native blow-flies <i>(Calliphora quadrimaculata)</i> were very much more abundant in the country districts than they are now. Mr. Mieville, who settled in the Mataura district in 1854, in his contribution to <i>Pioneer Recollections</i>, collected by Mr. H. Beattie (second series), says, `The trouble of pioneers is the bluebottle-fly, which is to be met with only in new country, where its ravages are beyond belief.'

Lots of confusion, popular use masquerading as official and confused official use; am working my way through but have to go back to Turnbull where a helpful young lady produced as I was leaving the NZ Almanacks which seem to be the ONLY source of official titles. Will chase them up further. People in Hansard use very loose terminology and there is no official listing of Ministers in Hansard.  The following is my best effort from the Wellington Almanack (and others): 1822-1850 No record. 1851  Commissioner for acquiring the      Cession of Lands from the Natives: - Donald McLean. 1851 Native Secretary H. Tacy Kemp £200 per annum [in addition to above]. 1852 Native Secretary [from Estimates]. 1853 Native Secretary Native Secretary's Department [from Estimates]. 1855 Native Secretary's Department [from Estimates]. 1857 Native Secretary - D.

Richmond Native Secretary's Office. 1862  Minister for Native Affairs - F.D. Bell (Acting) Native Secretary's Department OR Native Department. 1863 Native Minister - F.D. Bell Native Land Purchase Department - Crown Commissioner .. D.McLean Native Secretary's Department - Native Secretary D. McLean NOTE; This is the first time the big three Ministers are joined by a new portfolio. 1864  Minister for Native Affairs - Honourable William Fox Native Secretary's Department. 1866  Native Minister - Honorable A.H. Russell Native Department - Minister for Native Affairs - Honorable A.H. Russell. 1867  Native Minister - Honorable J.C. Richmond Native Department - Minister for      Native Affairs. 1868 Native Department - Under Secretary W. Rolleston. 1870 Ministry has now become Cabinet Donald McLean, Minister for Colonial Defence and Native Affairs. 1873  Honorable Donald McLean, Native Minister. 1878 Native Minister & Minister of Justice. 1879  Native and Defence Office Native Minister. 1880 Honorable John Boyce, Minister for Native Affairs Native Office. 1885 Native and Defence Minister Native Office. 1888 Minister of Public Works and Native Affairs. I gave up about here. Basically, you can take your pick.

Notes: NATIVE [MAORI] (CUSTOMARY) TITLE. A fascinating and still proceeding investigation. The phrase is not defined in the acts - Native is but not Native Title. There are at least two types of Native (Maori) title - customary, which I presume means communal (of the iwi), and freehold.  There will undoubtedly be more colloquial references in second readings to bills.  The earliest reference is quoted from "1847 NZPCC 387 n at 390" which I will need to consult with a lawyer about - the book in question doesn't have an explanation of NZPCC. (HWO note from 1990s)

Quote: The species of <i>Galaxias</i> may broadly be divided into the small, sea-running whitebait minnows (<i>Galaxias attenuatus</i>), the larger native `trout' (<i>G. fasciatus</i> and allied species), which probably breed inland, and an aberrant species of medium size (<i>G. borrowsii</i>) which approaches the Westland mudfish (<i>Neochanna apoda</i>) in form....The larger mottled brown native trout occur in most of the streams and lakes of Canterbury. Their breeding habits are little known from actual observation, but from the lack of evidence of a seaward migration it is inferred that they breed in the streams and lakes.

Notes: A small round short-pastry tart with a custard filling but especially characterised by the icing, half of which is black and half white; in Dunedin with a peppermint flavour (check). Other variations in the filling include lemon juice, rum essence or vanilla. Known to me from Dunedin in 1952. An Australian version (see below) is on a biscuit base instead of being in a tart and includes a layer of jam but has the essential bicoloured icing. Possible origins of the name : Nimes (in France); Neen in Shropshire (Neenton, Neen Savage, Neen Sollars); have been told of a Dutch woman making them. There is an outside chance it might be related to the neem tree ("a meliaceous tree of India and Ceylon, sometimes 50 feet high... The natives chew its small twigs and use them as tooth brushes") but I think not. David Burton does not mention them in his books on the raj. Kathryn Walls knows the lemon-flavoured variety from Invercargill (thought they were bakery rather than home-made), Vincent had heard of them, Bill Manhire hadn't. Nelson Wattie does not know them from NZ but when the bicoloured icing was described said he knew them from Germany as "Americans", possibly because of the black and white racial suggestion. Tony Simpson makes, them, his mother made them, his grandmother made them, but he doesn't know anything about the origin. The name appears as a headword in the Macquarie Dictionary but none other that I can find. None of the books on the cookery shelves at National Library has them, not do any of the present stock of second-hand ones in Quilter's but then most modern cookery books are written (or compiled) by restaurant chefs who do not bake and not by bakery cooks.

The whalers, therefore, tried to get a bomb into a bull in a near vital spot. But sometimes the chaser got out of position, and one of the other chasers would fire their harpoon into it. This was called `Nelly-birding'.

These epithets, almostalready forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; and the origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation.

Quote: I am - a New Chum.   My business is to critcise, moralise upon, compare, sketch, and, where necessary, correct or praise the peculiarities of my adopted countrymen.   First, then, arises this question: what is a 'New Chum'? and it may be answered in two ways, according to the manner in which it is asked.   For there is a real New Chum; and there is a New Chum that is ideal only.   The New Chum proper, is, I understand, a person who has but freshly come to the Colony from some part or other of the old world.   The New chum that most colonists, here, appear to have in their mind's eye, is quite a different being in most cases.   He is a pattern of neatness and elegance in his dress; of cheek and superciliousness in his deportment; of ignorance, meanness, cowardice, spiritlessness, vagueness, helplessness in time of emergency, vanity, presumption, and emptiness, in his temperament; and of all these vices, combined with effeminate and pedantic precision, in his talk.   His delight is to abuse colonial customs; to run down the local 'bigwigs'; to show contempt for the industries and pursuits of the colonists generally; and affect a languid indifference to the matters which most engage their interest.   His purse is even emptier than his head.  He is without resources and without pluck.  His ambition is at once low and unreasonable.   he puts his trust in letters of introduction, and looks for a Government billet.

Thegirl said to Mr Holland: `You can't call us new New Zealanders; it's too clumsy. Why not NewEnzedders?' `That is excellent.' said Mr Holland. `we will use it'.

Quote: [Old Identity] was the name applied by the people of Victoria, who flocked hither in thousands on the discovery of gold [in 1862], to those who had been in the province before that time. Those honest folks, the tenour of whose ways had previously been very even, were greatly startled by this immense and sudden influx of population. 16,000 persons landed in three months, andeverything went up to worse than famine prices. It is alleged that one minister actually prayed that the stream of rogues and vagabonds which was flowing into the country might be stayed, but this I believe to have been a base invention of the `new iniquity', as the new-comers were nicknamed.

Definition:As an attributive from the Country's name, it had in very early times, a connotation NATIVE, MAORI (cf NEW ZEALANDER) often with suggestions of roughness, wildness, or barbarism. It was quickly adapted (see 1840 entry) to include the white settlers and the civilised homeland they were preparing, a sense and use which obliterated the earlier.  Many uses (eg New Zealand Company (1839), New Zealand Gazette) were merely defining, and had, of themselves, no racial reference.

A Governor-in-Chief rules the whole of New Zealand and is assisted in his legislation by a Council constituted similarly to the provincial Councils. At present, the Governor-in-Chief holds the subordinate office of Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster , in addition to his higher Commission: and Mr Eyre is the Lieutenant of New Munster, the southern province.

Quote: Of the three islands forming the Zealand group, Rakiura, or the small South Island, is the only one which possesses a native name. Since the days of Cook, the North Island has been named on old maps Eaheinomawe, and the Middle Island Tavai-poenammo. These names originated thus. When the great navigator asked the natives the name of the North Island, he was told that it was `a thing fished from the sea by Maui,' - He mea hi no Maui; and that the Middle Island was Te wahi pounamu, or `the place of the greenstone.'  When New Zealand became a British colony, the first governor, who was an Irishman, proclaimed that the North, Middle, and South Island were thenceforth to be denominated respectively New Ulster, New Munster, and New Leinster; and these names he selected for the colony because New Zealand, like Irelands, had no toads. This modern method of naming places by applying the epithet `New' to countries which are as old as the originals is not only incorrect, but possesses many disadvantages. The Constitution Act of 1852 discarded this unsuitable nomenclature, and the North, Middle, and Stewart's Islands are the names now invariably given to them by the settlers, and those by which they are familiar toseamen. The South Island was named in honour of the sealer who, in 1808, discovered its insularity. Sentimental settlers designate New Zealand the Britain of the southern hemisphere, on the same principle that the Dutchman Tasman, who discovered the country, called it New Zealand.

Quote:  `The name Aotearoa was made popular around 1898 with the publication of William Pember Reeves' book  The Long White Cloud - Aotearoa,' historian ... Sir Keith Sinclair says.  After 1870, most Maori referred to the country as Niu Tirani - a result of Pakeha settlers calling the three islands New Zealand.  Sir Keith said that in all the written Maori he had read from last century the word Aotearoa had been used in only one newspaper.  Te Wanaanga, published in Napier, used Aotearoa in the 1870s.  Sir Keith said Maori often referred to New Zealand by using `te motu nei' (in this island).  Sir Keith said the literal translation of Aotearoa was `land of the long twilight'.  The name may have come about because the early Polynesians were not used to the long evenings in New Zealand.

Quote: When we were living [in South Africa] in the 1960s, we heard of a citrus orchard in Rustenberg that grew hybrod oranges named Rex Union oranges, famous for making excellent marmalade. We went to this pretty little country town and found an orchard named 'Dunedin' and bought a bag of the oranges... What surprised us was that the Rex Union oranges seemed to be identical to our New Zealand grapefruit. Many years later.. I was reading about Morrison's Orchard in Warkworth and was struck by the statement that the original grapefruit tree had come from Kawau Island and that Sir George Grey couldn't remember where he had got the plant. Grey had been Governor of Cape Province, South Africa, from 1854-1861 and was known to have brought many South African plants to New Zealand. Are 'New Zealand grapefruit', 'Rex Union oranges'?

Quote: Related very closely to the still surviving Australian stubble quail, the New Zealand quail was once common in parts of the North and South Islands. Being a species living mainly in grasslands, it was more abundant in the South Island on its eastern side than in the North where its distribution was far more localised. By the mid-nineteenth century the koreke, as it was known to the Maori, was already uncommon in the North Island, though at about the same time it was still abundant in parts of Nelson and Otago. By 1870 it was regarded as having been completely exterminated in the North, and five years later the South Island populations had vanished too.

Quote: There is at least one sense, however, in which Cowan can be said to be ahead of his time. He steadfastly clung to the term `New Zealand Wars'. He rejected the more popular but misleadingexpression `Maori Wars', which implied that Maoris alone were responsible for the outbreaks of conflict. From the 1960s historians have explored more neutral and more accurate terms to characterise the period. Some opted for `Land Wars', but this is not entirely satisfactory because issues were involved in addition to that of land. Others suggested `Anglo-Maori Wars' but this too is less than adequate; the English were not the only Europeans involved and. as already noted, Maoris fought on both sides. For this latter reason `Maori-Pakeha Wars' is also unsuitable. ... If they are referred to as the New Zealand Wars they cannot be confused with any others, particularly if earlier actions involving Maoris alone are designated `tribal wars'.

He thanked them again most heartily, and said he wished their two Maori chiefs were present to give them their native song, but they had left the country. But they would endeavour to sing in the Maori tongue `For he's a jolly good fellow.' Led by Mr. Bray, the New Zealanders then sang `For he's a jolly good fellow ' with much effect. They then gave the `New Zealand Whisper' for the ladies, after which `God Save the King' was sung by all present, Mr. Naylor (of St. George's Chapel Choir ) leading. Three cheers were next given for the visitors, finishing with an `English whisper' for the New Zealand ladies. A most enjoyable time then terminated with all joining in `Auld Lang Syne'.

Quote: Prior to the arrival of European navigators such as Abel Tasman, Captain Cook and De Surville, the indigenous people of New Zealand had no one word for themselves as an ethnic group. Instead, they were known by their tribal names of Tuhoe, Ngapuhi, Ngati Porou, etc. For recording purposes this was too cumbersome, so in their writings the navigators referred to the inhabitants of the country as New Zealanders. The closest concept the people had for such an all-encompassing label was tangata whenua, people of the land. But this did not come into general use until later as it had a more specific meaning in tribal relations between hosts and guests.

The word pakeha serves themto signify all whites, whom they also call `Iouropi' (Europeans). I did not observe that they had a special name for the English.

Initially, much of their catching capacity had been through joint ventures, but increasingly they used their own vessels â€¦ While this investment set the foundation for the New Zealandisation of the deepwater fishery, it increased pressure on the inshore fishery.

Other (less clipped) renderings of the broad New Zild pronunciation recorded in <i>DNZE</i> include <i>New Zillun(d)</i> and <i>Noo Zilland</i> and, more idosyncratically, <i>NyaZilnd, N'yerzillun</i>, and <i>Newzyullind</i>.

Definition:an abusive and contemptuous term for MAORI relatively rare (at least in written record) since the Land Wars of the 1860's, when it was especially frequent among Taranaki settlers, regimental soldiers (?fresh from India and other colonial venues) In theRichmond-Atkinson Papers (1960), up to 1860, except for one use by Jane Maria (1860 July 171/618) and one by H. Ronalds in  his Diary of the Taranaki War (1860 Mar. 9, 1/535), it seems the personal use of A.S. Atkinson all in his private journal and not in his `public' letters. His first use is Aug 18, 1855 (see quote), thence  1856 June 10, with two more `playful' uses of negroes, the first curious (1858 Sep 19, I-429 `Consulted with Maria whether it would be well to go among the Negroes for six months to learn Maori'), the second 1859 Mar 8 I-452 `Attended conference between Negroes and Governor'.

Quote:  Skin colour and the mixture of blood which is responsible for it [sc. high visibility in a white world] are often commented on by one Maori to another. The terms `mongrel', `black mongrel', `dago', or `black nigger', for instance, are often used by Maoris either in referring to themselves or to other Maoris in the neighbourhood. Thus one informant, in introducing herself, remarked: `I'm only a mongrel' - meaning only a mixed-blood Maori.

Quote: Nikau fronds make an ideal impromptu shelter.. but the palm was important to Maori not just for thatching but also for weaving and as a food source: the young flower stalks and heart ("millionaire's salad") were the parts most commonly eaten. Even so, the first Polynesian arrivals to Aotearoa were no doubt nonplussed that the local palm did not bear edible fruit like the cocnut. Indeed, one explanation for the origin of the name "nikau" is that it means "no nuts."

There were coconuts here then, and probably crocodiles, but that was before the Big Chill. The crocs and coconuts didn't survive the ice ages but nikau palms came through.

In consequence it is one of the things that is always available round a farm when you need to build or repair something. It is said that some cockies can put together a landrover, a tractorand half a milk shed with nothing but a roll of number 8. Wire comes in sizes ranging from 1 to approx. 64, with 1 being the thickest. Number 8 is 5/32 of an inch or about half the diameter of a pencil.

Being the first Taranaki gate he had encountered, he studied the primitive contraption with a puzzled frown, then realised it was simplicity itself. `Just lift off this wire loop.' The gate sprang from his fingers, coiled into the air and collapsed in a tangled heap. Christoffer cursed the man who had invented it. However he had to admit that it was an efficient, cheap and easily-made thing - a sort of `instant gate'. <i>Ibid.</i> 150 The swing bridge, made of No 8 fencing wire, made a good support for the pipelines.

Hailed from somewhere down the Wire Wrapper. A right useless bastard. Couldn't see the road to the dunny if it had red flags on it. Well, it seems that he's shacked up with some pluty Remmers sheila and she's about to drop her bundle.' ... A non-New Zealander will probably require a translation, ... My friend is communicating to me the information that a slow-witted, incompetent person of diminutive stature, who was reared in the Wairarapa district and worked for a time in the killing gang of an abattoir, is now cohabiting with a wealthy woman from the affluent Auckland suburb of Remuera. This woman is soon to give birth.

Quote: Northern rata (Metrosideros robusta) does grow naturally in Wellington (in the South Island from Hokitika northwards).  Both are known as the New Zealand Christmas tree... Pohutukawa doesn't grown naturally here; it is a weed in parts of the region; it occupies sites where the northern rata should be; being closely related to the northern rata, pohutukawa has the potential to hybridise; pohutukawa inhibits the growth of other plants; northern rata's bloom is superior to pohutukawa's.

They are bars that allow you to purchase nitrous oxide in balloons, and sit on a couch, or around a table outside, and inhale the gas to get high. Similar to places like Cosmic Corner in what they sell, the sit down environment provides a safe place to use a safe drug. Better than doing it on the street.

Quote: Kate Wilson, a Middlemarch farmer and one of the women behind rural website Not Just Gumboots and Scones, says the Internet is a serious tool for women involved in rural businesses. Not Just Gumboots and Scones was one of New Zealandâ€™s first rural information portals, built well before the launch of large commercial sites like www.fencepost.com. Ms Wilson, who farms sheep and hazelnuts with her husband, says Not Just Gumboots and Scones is being rethought to make it even more relevant and easy to use.

Quote: The 'sterotypical perception of a rural woman' is what prompted a group of country ladies to set up an organisation in the late 1990s called Not Just Gumboots & Scones. Their website (www.notjust.org.nz) allows rural women to learn about and share views on all sorts of issues, but, in fine country style, it was launched in a woolshed with gumboots and scones much in evidence.

Quote: As used in relation to weeds in New Zealand, the term `noxious' is a confusing one, as it has two distinct meanings. In a general, non-specific sense, it denotes any weed regarded as significant, for one reason or another, by the use of the term. It has, however, a precise legal meaning denoting weeds whose control and eradication are required under the provisions of the Noxious Weeds Act of 1950 and its amendments. These are the so called `noxious weeds'.

Quote: Stray notes on Australia and the Diggings (Griffiths Collection) Origin of he word `Nugget'. - This word, now so common amongst our population, is a strange sounding word, and destitute of any apparent entymological meaning. It originated at the Ophir diggings in New South Wales, and is probably a corruption of `ingot', which is itself a corruption of `lingot', a little tongue. The wedge of gold which Achan purloined is called, in the original Hebrew, a `tongue' of gold, as a reference to a Bible with marginal readings will show. In California, the word `lump' is generally used, and sometimes the Spanish word `pepite.'

The gold-diggers were washing the soil of a mountain-stream in the machine called `long-tom'. In excavating the banks they displaced several large boulders of quartzy rock, underneath which was discovered the living frog. The gold-diggers, who voluntarily submit to the evils and miseries of such a gambling trade, and can rarely be excited by anything unless a great nugget, were so much astonished at the sight of a frog that one of them desisted fom the seductive occupation he was at, and took the frog, and put it into a bottle of water.

Notes: 1984 Orsman letter to an enquirer Nugget `boot polish' is a New Zealand and Australian word used, I think, from before the First World War. Eric Partridge in his A Dictionary of Slang gives it as Australian colloquial from about 1910 - the date he thought he first remembered it from. I have it in my collections, but have no early date for it as I have not yet checked it up in advertisements of old newspapers, nor written to the company that produces it to ask them when they adopted  Nugget as a brand-name, and why. I assume it comes from nugget `a small lump', as in nugget of gold. Perhaps you or the class might like to write to the Nugget company and ask them about this. It's also now used as a verb - `to nugget shoes ', for example. It's like many other brand-names that have passed into common speech: e.g. hoover for `vacuum cleaner': to hoover a room, etc.

Quote: BLIND TORPEDO RAY OR NUMBFISH <i>Typhlonarke aysoni</i> (Hamilton)  [ibid]. 92]. This uncommon fish has several names, all of which relate to its manner of producing electricshocks, some of which are Numb-fish, Crampfish and Electric Skate. These vernacular names are given by fishermen on account of the fish benumbing or paralysing the person who unwittingly grasps one with his hands. The last name is from the somewhat similar shape to that of a skate or ray, ray being another common term for skates and also the scientific family name.
