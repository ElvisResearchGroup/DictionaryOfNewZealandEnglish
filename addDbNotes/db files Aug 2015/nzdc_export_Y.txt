Quote: One has noticed in some reviews of Young Adult Fiction published in your weekly, a tendency for otherwise excellent critics to tut-tut over the fact that some protagonists may be persons with problems... One has even read accusations in another publication that writers of YA fiction who present such porotagonists are somewhow guilty of depriving our children of their childhood"... But to imply that all such re-creations of the world should be frowned upon in YA books ... dare one whsiper the words "double standard"?

Quote: [Queen Charlotte Sound] The food of the New-Zealanders is chiefly fish, some of which they dry and some they eat raw: They also have some yams upon the northern Island, but not in lenty; ...  [ed. note Helen M. Gilkey 237] Yam, <i>Dioscorea</i> spp. Dioscoreaceae. The word `yam', as used in the Pacific Islands, commonly refers not to a form of sweet potato, as in America, but to a species of  Dioscorea which belong to a completely unrelated plant family. One wonders, however, if Ledyard in his reference to yams in New Zealand ... did not mean the sweet potato; for in Hooker's Handbook of New Zealand Flora, ...1864, no mention is made of the presence of <i> Dioscorea</i> in these islands at that time, but of the sweet potato <i> (Ipomoea batatas</i> Poir.) it is said, `now much cultivated in New Zealand'. Certainly, however, throughout most (if not all) his journal, Ledyard uses `yam' in its ordinary South-Pacific connotation. Several species of  Dioscorea were used by the inhabitants of various islands visited during the expedition, some being cultivated. All, apparently, had previously been introduced from Malaya.

"When you glanced in the rearview mirror of your Dorset as it strained up a hill and flinched at the sight of a set of heavy chrome teeth grinning at you as the V8 of some American dream machine chafed in your wake, the sour grapes hardened to hostility," McCrystal writes. Hence the term "Yank tank" entered the post-war idiom, coined from "one part disrespect, 10 parts envy."

Quote: I yoked up the bullocks. The bullock yoke was a square piece of white pine smoothed and hollowed out to fit the necks of the two bullocks, with holes for the iron bows which went round the neck and through the yoke, being fastened above with a key tied with a bit of greenhide; in the centre a bolt with a ring called `the start' passed through the yoke, to which the chain was fastened from the sledge. <i>IBid.</i> Dec 18 p. 43. At Macfarlane's the men saddled fresh horses and rode in some cattle which we had a great bother to yard, as everything was new ... The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiring branding, and after hauling them up to a corner post, leg-roped and threw them on [44] their side, placing a long lever on their neck and under the lowest rail so that they would not move much ... When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.

These butterflies are strong fliers, and are found throughout most of the country, including Stewart Island. They also occur in Australia, and it is thought that they make regular crossings of the Tasman Sea.

She thought it might be regional. I went to school 18m south of Hawera and we certainly called baby birds youngkies, although I might have spelt it "younkie."  We also called them "younks".

Quote: [Hdg] Forecasters warn of yo-yo summer. We’ve all heard of “El Nino” and more recently the ‘weather bomb” - now we can look forward to the “yo-yo” summer. MetService spokesman Bob McDavitt says that the front that has brought heavy rain and strong winds over the North Island is part of a “yo-yo” summer. Like a yo-yo, the weather goes up and goes down.

Quote: When late last month the MetService described a "yo-yo" weather pattern, most people interpreted that as good weather interspersed with bursts of bad, which is typical for the region. But this yo-yo no longer seems to retract. Its string has unwound and it is dangling.

Quote: Boom boom - and bang. That's the sound of the hefty door on a $94,000 Discovery Land Rover 2003, the kind of four-wheel drive that makes columnist Frank Haden writhe, a Yummy Mummy car designed for the off-road, bought by the in-crowd... "I can look down on chicks' laps while driving," says Greg Grieves.. another Honda CRV driver who's sold on the 4WD experience. He's a Yummy Daddy, a Ponsonby father of two whose last car was an Audi S6.
