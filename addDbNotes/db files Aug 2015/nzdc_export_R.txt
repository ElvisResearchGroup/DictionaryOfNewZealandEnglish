Quote:  raddled: This word means `robbed' in the sense of being deprived of one's proper payment. It is an extension of `raddling', carried out by unscrupulous farmers before the Shearers' Union looked after shearers' interests. Any sheep considered unsatisfactorily shorn was marked with red or blue raddle and such a sheep would not be counted in the shearer's

tally. The raddle stick was also called a `Toby'. This must not be confused with [27] marking a sheep for other purposes, such as identification of certain sheep for easy selection later.

Quote:  The natives always treat a rahui with much respect, considering it an act of great dishonesty to catch eels, or any other fish, to hunt pigs, snare ducks or parrots, or in fact destroy in any way or [sic] game of whatever kind which it is erected to preserve. So strictly is this code carried out, that a short time ago - (and even now in some parts of the island) the infringement of a rahui would be considered quite a sufficient <i>casus belli</i> to give rise to a bloody war between two tribes.

Quote:  A new vegetable said to be ideal for stir-frys, curries and salads is ready for planting and could be in the shops in time for Christmas dinner. It is a small onion, described by Crop and Food Research scientists who developed it as a cross between shallots and chives. Its taste is mild, somewhere between garlic and onion, and it is crisp in texture. Known in Japan as rakkyo and used in a popular pickle called tsukemono,it was brought to New Zealand in 1997 to be tested as a commercial vegetable.

Sources as their own. <i>Ibid.</i> 11

The New Zealand Maori Council has explained the concept of Rangatiratanga as meaning more

than `possession':  `it means the wise administration of all the assets possessed by a group for that group's benefit: in a word, trusteeship'  (Te Wahanga Tuatahi, 1983, p 5)  In the Crown's view, the First and Second Articles of the Treaty are both strong statements which necessarily

qualify one another. Kawanatanga is subject to a promise to protect  Rangatiratanga. Rangatiratanga is subject to an acknowledgment of Kawanatanga. The working out in practice of the balance between the two Articles must depend upon a case by case consideration. ... It is the right of all citizens, Maori, Pakeha, and other New Zealanders, that there be effective Government or Kawanatanga in such matters.

Quote:  Another widespread silicic airfall tephra reported from southern North Island is the Rangitawa Pumice and its possible correlatives, the Omahina Tephra (Pillans 1979), the Lower Finnie Road Ash (Seward 1974 ; Pillans & Kohn 1981), and the Mangaroa Ash (Neeser et al. 1980), all with fission-track dates in the two-standard deviation age range of 370 ± 70 ky BP (Pillans & Kohn 1981; Kyle & Seward 1984; Kohl 1986, oral presentation).  The site 594 tephra could therefore be equivalent to the Rangitawa Pumice and its correlatives.

Quote:  From the air, Rangitoto's 258 m high sunmmit looks more like a green poached egg than a rugged volcanic cone. Molten lava spewed from around the crater as recently as 600 years ago and plenty of raw rock is still visible between the clumps of encroaching trees. While the eruptions left Rangitoto with a black and scaly skin, ash deposited on neighbouring Motutapu Island.. smoothed the topography and endowed it with up to two metres of rich topsoil. <i><Ibid.</i> 24 ...[Tamatekapua's] fate endures in the island's full name - "Te Rangi I Totongia A Tametakapua" or "the day the blood of Tametekapua was shed"... The early eruptions of Rangitoto were the most ferocious, driven by seawater flashing steam as it encountered fresh magma at 1200 degrees C.

We need an Eric Partridge to record these Kiwi colloquialisms like underground mutton, Rangitoto Yankees, leather ladies (possums hit by trains in tunnels, where the flies don't get to them and they petrify) and the Waiouru blondes (sheep).

Quote:  Some accept the meaning I use : to infuriate someone by teasing, to the amusement of those in the know. But for one who agrees, three or four insist <i>rark</i> refers to a justified telling-off. Ted Anderson writes to say he grew up in Nelson and his wife Anne in Thames, and the pair of them have always used <i>rark</i> to mean stirring one up when they deserve it... Donald Macintosh Campbell... ferreted out Fr P S Dineen's <i>Dictionary of the Irish Language</i> which gives <i>radharc mo shul do bhaite</i>, meaning essentially "to fool me" and shortened to <i>radharc</i>. Since the letters <i>dh</i> in the middle of <i>radharc</i> are silent, like the <i>gh</i> in night, the pronunciation was <i>rarc</i>. Either way, it's fun to be rarked up.

Gunn, Esq., of Launceston, dated Waitangi, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, 4th September, 1850:- `I have procured two specimens of the ancient, and all but quite extinct, New Zealand Rat, which until just now (and notwithstanding all my endeavours, backed, too,

by large rewards) I never saw. It is without doubt a true Mus, smaller than our English black rat (Mus Rattus), and not unlike it. This little animal once inhabited the plains and Fagus forests of New Zealand in countless thousands, and was both the common food and great delicacy of the natives - and already it is all but quite classed among the things which were.'

Quote:  It is invariably erect and never climbing, although bushmen and settlers frequently state that it climbs the loftiest trees, and sooner or later squeezes them to death in its iron clasp. In proof of this they assert that, when felling huge ratas, they often find a dead tree in the centre of the rata: this is a common occurrence, but it by no means follows that this species is a climber. The error is simply due to imperfect observation, which has led careless observers to confuse [<I>M. scandens</I> the Aka], which is a true climber with <I>M. robusta</I>.

Quote:  <i>Rata, n.</i> Maori name for two New Zealand erect or sub-scandent flowering trees, often embracing trunks of forest trees and strangling them: the Northern Rata, <i> Metrosideros robusta </i> , A. Cunn., and the Southern Rata, <i> M. lucida </i> , Menz., both of the N.O. <i> Myrtacea </i> . The tree called by the Maoris Aka, which is another species of <i> Metrosideros (M. florida)</i> , is also often confused with the Rata by bushmen and settlers. In Maori, the adj. <i> rata </i>  means red-hot, and there may be a reference to the scarlet appearance of the flower in full bloom. The timber of the Rata is often known as <i> Ironwood </i> , or <i> Ironbark </i> . The trees rise to sixty feet in height; they generally begin by trailing downwards from the seed deposited on the bark of some other tree near its top. When the trailing branches reach the ground they take root there and sprout erect. For full account of the habit of the trees, see quotation 1867 (Hochstetter), 1879 (Moseley), and 1889 (Kirk).

I have reared specimens from groundsel, meliolotus, and the recently introduced Neogeora burr, while the common sow thistle or rauriki is everywhere attacked, and seems to be the favourite food plant.

The speaker mistrakenly supposes the plant to be named from its taste. It is actually edible and much used by the Maoris as rauriki, corruptly `radicky'.

Quote:  If he were sure he could recognise it, writes Mr T. P. Moloney, he would gather rauriki and get his wife to cook it, for he enjoyed it years ago in Maori cooking, in the King Country, where it was called by the pakeha `Maori cabbage.'  <i> Rauriki </i> is the common succulent thistle, growing 2ft to 3ft high, that the children gathering it for pet rabbits and guinea pigs, call milk thistle, because of the abundant flow of milky white sap from it. Actually there are two species' Sonchus oleraceus, whose lobed leaves are only mildly prickly and flat, or at the most very slightly waved at the edges, and S. asper, very similar except that the leaves are much more prickly, and are waved or crimped around the edges. The flowers are yellow, rather like those of a dandelion, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. <i> Chewing Gum </i>  According to some people, rauriki is the Maori name of the former and puwha of the latter, but I do not know that the Maoris went in for such nice distinctions. Different tribes had different names for the same thing. Puwha, as well as being one of the names for the sow thistle, seems to have been also used sometimes as a general term for any cooked greens, of which sow thistle was the favourite.

Quote:  At Oxford, Makereti (Maggie Papakura) wrote: `I myself gather the sow thistle here and cook it to eat, as it reminds me of our own puwha, of which I am very fond. Puwha was used only as a vegetable ... The succulent stems contained a bitter milky juice which came to the surface when the flower tops were plucked off. This was left, on a sunny day, for a few hours, then gathered between the thumb and first finger, adding the thick creamy mass of several plants together. This was used as a sort of chewing gum, called pia or ngau, which tasted very bitter at first. But after a little chewing, the bitterness disappeared, and this gum was much enjoyed, especially by the women, who vied with each other in seeing who could make her pia crack the loudest.'

Quote:  BLIND TORPEDO RAY OR NUMBFISH <i>Typhlonarke aysoni</i> (Hamilton) [ibid. 92]. This uncommon fish has several names, all of which relate to its manner of producing electric shocks, some of which are Numb-fish, Crampfish and Electric Skate. These vernacular names are given by fishermen on account of the fish benumbing or paralysing the person who unwittingly grasps one with his hands. The last name is from the somewhat similar shape to that of a skate or ray, ray being another common term for skates and also the scientific family name.

On most farms, even a large river narrows to the point where it could be stepped across. Similarly there will be a wide point where even a larger river can be crossed wearing red-bands.

Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occured in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood.

Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green.

Quote:   ... I issued a  circular, stating that the Federation would stand behind the tramwaymen in any action that they might take.  I had no authority whatever for issuing the circular, and in looking back on that time now, can only account for my impetuous action through my anger at the contempt displayed towards organised Labour by the City Council and the press. The leaflet (which happened to be printed on red paper, this giving the idea to the `Evening Post' [in early 1912] that was responsible for the coining of the term `Red Federation,' which was afterwards abbreviated to `Red Fed.') caused a wave of militancy to sweep through the tramway service, and a meeting was called for the p.m. shift the following day.

"Farmers in the North Island," he said, "were giving their whole-hearted support to the Liberals, and although the Prime Minister was endeavouring to make party capital out of 'Red-Fedism,' the farmers had not forgotten that the Government had helped to secure the return of active supporters of the Red-Fed. movement."

Quote:  ...it may be prudent to mention that the Australian red-back spider (<i>Latrodectus hasselti</i>) has become firmly established in New Zealand in the last couple of years, so we can deal with three closely related comb-footed spider species in the space of one story... In other words, the black widow is really nothing more than the American katipo, and the red-back is the Australian katipo.

Quote:  Some reference sires are used in successive years to create genetic links, which allows EBVs to be compared across years. Other reference sires are replaced by superior rams, identified by their across-flock EBVs. Thus the reference sires have a dual role, creating genetic links across flocks and years and producing more rapid dissemination of genetic improvement.

Truly, this pubbery was just short of shanty, typical of the `Outer Barcoo', but where Maories, their Wahines, or broken down `Remittancers' could drown their sorrows, wander into the `arms of Bacchus' or chase pink elephants.

Quote:  Reo - while the word is often translated as 'the language', this explanation hides the fact that the Maori language is revered as a living record of its people, and enshrines the ethos of the people. No one can fully know `te reo' unless one is acquainted with the proverbs, legends, histories and knowledge of all tribal groups and areas. Yet it is a lifetime work knowing 'te reo' of one's own tribal area.

The reti consists of a canoe-shaped board about a foot long with a spinning bait attached with about four feet of strong line. The board is thrown into the current on its edge and is held against the current and allowed to drift out into the breakers, generally on about 100 yards of line. The moment a fish is struck the whole affair is brought in.

Quote:  Alison Nevill, of Dunedin, asks about the fascinating phrase "the whole rick-ma-tick". She says her Scottish grandmother employed a maid in the 40s who used it constantly, meaning something like "that's all there is to it". The maid came from Stirling, and the family always thought it was one of her home-town expressions, so when Alison got to New Zealand, she was surprised to hear it being used in the same context of finality. "The whole rick-ma-tick" has a long and honourable history as a Scottish version of "the whole kit and caboodle", an expression from the United States east coast that is widely understood here as an ornate alternative to "the whole lot".

The <i>Zosterops</i> was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and ... we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; ... and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.

St.Ch-ch `No jars or riggers filled after 5-45 pm.'

Quote:  Many quality New Zealand beers are never bottled and are only available on tap from the brewery or a bottle store in 1.25 or 2 litre plastic bottles (called variously riggers, flagons or PETs depending on where you are from). I headed off to Regional Wines, and Spirits with a bag of empty riggers to sample some of their beers on tap... While beer in a rigger will keep fresh for a short time, ideally it should be consumed within a day or two of purchase.

The word is common in the same sense in English forestry and horticulture, and only seems Australasian from its more frequent use, owing to the widespead practice of clearing the primeval forests and generally destroying trees. `Ringed' is the correct past participle, but `rung' is now

commonly used. [1846] ... (2) to make cattle move in a circle. [1874] ... (3) To move round in a circle [1884] ...  (4) To make the top score at a shearing-shed.' See Ringer.

Quote:  Merino sheep on the flat, especially when coming to a gate, are apt to circle. The centre of the mob may stand still, or move slowly forward; but the outside sheep gallop round and round them. This is  called ringing. It is annoying to see the sheep racing past the gate instead of going through it, but the habit may be turned to the shepherd's advantage. By starting the sheep on one side ringing the reverse way, two streams of sheep can be made to meet at the gate, and carry one another through.

Quote:  The idea is to ringbark the trees and bore through the trunk with an augur a couple of holes which are filled with a composition and plugged. The composition soaks into the wood, rots it, and causes it to become inflammable. In about eight or ten months a match is applied, and the tree falls, the stump and roots which have become soaked with the mixture, being burned right out.

Quote:  The new genus, Ringanui, is a significant step in resolving this

confusion. Ringanui differs from Paraleptamphopus on several characters and is most easily

recognised by diverse gnathopods, the first of which is enlarged relative to gnathopod 2. The two

species are described and illustrated in detail. They differ in size and gnathopod characteristics, but

other differences are small. Ringanui koonuiroa is the smaller species and is most easily recognised

by the single, very long robust seta defining the palm of gnathopod 1. The second species, R.

toonuiiti, is the larger, but its palmar defining spine is relatively short.

The ringer could be the best of several gun shearers in the same shed, but he could also be a ringer in a weak team and not even be a gun. A possible origin of the term can be found under `quoits' but others are that the ringer `runs rings round the rest' and the ringer in Yorkshire dialect means anyone superlatively good.

Quote:  Some of the typical terms used in marbles referred to the act of shooting and the movement of the marbles. Those related to ways of shooting marbles were cribbing, firsts, fudging, funks, funnicks, funnigans, flunks, forces, knee-high, knuckle-down-stiff, knuckles, and lasts. Terms connected with the movement of the marbles were: cannons, clears, dead-stick, double-hits,

fires, funs, gees, haystacks, in smug, keeps, kills, kisses, lay-ups, manyes, ones, pink, ringer, rolls, scat, screws, skinned, skun, spiders, sported-off, stays, stops, tracks, throughs.

<I>Ibid.</I> 176 [Waitara, Taranaki, 1899: reference, game of Little Ring] Many heated arguments arose as to who said `everythings' or `nothings' first. If a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime.

The `riffleboard' was detachable and formed a `false bottom'. `Riffle' was probably a Californian term; `ripple' seems to have been more usual on the goldfields of Australasia.

Quote:  Hadfield in his 1839 diary mentions eating a meal which included boiled flour. This is probably the same food which became known to the Maoris later as riripi. It consisted of flour and water, with sugar [53] to sweeten, boiled and served up as a kind of porridge. In the early whaling days it was often served up to a whole village community from a canoe set up like a trough from which the villagers scooped their requirements in large bowls or paua shells. Many of the Ngati Raukawa of Otaki have vivid recollections of having eaten riripi in their childhood.

Quote:  Rise: A timbered excavation constructed by working upwards, using upper holes. Rising was done on the three-compartment system, that is with a ladderway on one end and a return airway on the other, with a `box' in the centre. This box was kept filled with ore and used to stand on while drilling the roof, the level of the ore being maintained by, drawing off the surplus ore through a chute at the bottom of the box. Rises were about 9 ft by 4 ft in section and might reach from one level to the next (about 150 ft), or to a sublevel, or from a stope to the level above.

This partly explains the importance of the `roads and bridges member' in the New Zealand Parliament, a term that has well-nigh disappeared. One might laugh at him and deplore his preoccupation with local matters, but road or bridge could be life or death to an outback settler. The central Government was the main source of bounty, so grants were continually asked for.

Roxburgh and Cromwell are well behind, and I slow down ... to

enjoy the sight of the water gushing from the spillway of the newly-erected power station at the Roaring Meg corner of the [Kawarau] Gorge. This heavy stream, which breaks so suddenly on a stranger from its very rough surroundings, got its name (according to early-day tradition) from the fact that Meg, one of the two girls on their way to a dancing saloon at Arrow, created such a fuss at crossing this turbulent water that vibrations of her voice loosened rocks on the mountain side to add still further to the roaring of stream and of Meg herself. There are different versions concerning the naming of this stream, and maybe some of this one is my own. ... A few miles

further on the next stream to be crossed is the Gentle Annie, called after Meg's pal, who no doubt was a much quieter type of tourist than Meg herself.

Quote:  Q. What sort of fish did you obtain at New Zealand? A.A great variety and many of the fish are very good. There are snappers (schnapper), mullet, bream, soles, eels, and a great quantity of cockles, and some rock oysters. There is likewise abundance of lobsters, or a fish between a lobster and a craw-fish.

The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. In the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.

Both these and "Thatchernomics" ultimately derive their inspiration from the dreaded "Friedmanite monetarism" which does not.. have anything to do with a hectoring American economist who is keen on the works of Monet, but instead has everything to do with a hectoring American economist who has, over the last 10 years, thrown millions of people out of work throughout the Western world.

Rogernomics deregulated where Muldoon had regulated, turned over to market forces those whom Muldoon had subsidised, cut taxes where Muldoon had raised them, subjected employers and unions to the painful wage discipline of controls on the money supply, exposed Muldoon's State departments to the market by turning trading operations into corporations, and requiring some other departments to earn part of their keep by selling their services.

All the scrub is closely cut down for a width of from twenty-five to thirty feet ... to obtain an approximately even surface, inclined towards the creek. The logs are forced along this road by timber-jacks, which the bushmen use with remarkable skill, and are impelled with a rapidity which is simply astonishing to persons unused to the process. If the creek contains plenty of water the logs float to the nearest booms without further trouble ...

Quote:  Hochstetter in 1889 and Kirk in 1874 [Report to Parliament], refer to rolling roads. Kirk describes them as `broad tracks, thirty to forty feet wide, in which every advantage is taken of the natural incline of the surface, and from which all trees have to be removed, the stumps cut level with the surface, inequalities roughly levelled, and large holes filled up. The logs are forced along these roads by `timberjacks' until they reach the water. In this way the logs are moved with great ease. ...[D.H.McMillan] Rolling roads were formed by laying three rickers or other small trees lengthwise to the line of road, and logs were placed crosswise on this road. There might be thirty or forty or more in a fleet. Three men with timber lacks usually operated this job.

was a new development... The Friesan cows

walk into individual bails on the slowly

revolving platform; the milking cups go

on; each cow does a circuit; the cups

are automatically removed; and then the

cows receive a light spray of water which

serves to nudge them out of the bail

They were playing around with names for the band and came up with Rotovegas.  I have not been able to find anything yet to confirm this - unfortunately we have not indexed the Daily Post for the 1980s yet.

This was probably for the intense orange of the flowers... In its home in California, great sweeps of egg-yolk gold against the blue leaves are breathtaking. Since the rotten egg has become a darling of the landscape designer, several colours have evolved, including pink, a near brown, and a beautiful soft clotted-cream that comes true from seed year after year.

Quote:  Their chief quest was a pot hole which might be described as much like a Maori rua or potato pit. A soft seam of rock played on by the tumbling waters and some stones always on the grind and move, wore down and sideways till the top was smaller than the bottom and an arched roof was the result, and a small opening at the top received through the ages particles of gold. The heavy swirl and pressure of water was unable to twist the gold contents out of the pot hole, and so a store of gold collected in the bottom and might contain nuggets as well as dust.

Quote:  Run.- The pioneers of sheep farming in New Zealand and Australia came from various classes; but there were few among them who had been sheep farmers before and fewer still who were scientists. If they had been sheep farmers they would probably have used the English or Scotch sheep farming words (as they did to some extent) and fitted them to the new conditions. If they had been scientists they would have invented exact names for everything new, and translated them into Latin. What they did do was to take the handiest word they could think of and give it a new meaning, As time went on the word they had chosen changed or extended its meaning. The best example of all  this is the word run.

Quote:  Run, n. (1) Tract of land over which sheep or cattle may graze.  It is curious that what in England is called a sheep-walk, in Australia is a sheep-run. In the Western United States it is a sheep -ranch. Originally the squatter, or sheep-farmer, did not own the land. It was unfenced, and he simply had the right of grazing or `running' his sheep or cattle on it. Subsequently, in many cases, he purchased the freehold, and the word is now applied to a large station- property, fenced or unfenced. (See quotation, 1883.) [1826]

Quote:  First a run is a parcel of land as leased. A sheepfarmer might own several adjacent runs of land, in this sense, and the whole `station' so formed might also be termed a  run. In the third sense a  run was leasehold as opposed to freehold land; in a fourth sense, open land as opposed to fenced land. It might be used as an adjective, e.g. run cattle. It might be the equivalent of  station but without including the sheep, i.e. `He sold his run' need not imply that he sold his sheep, but `He sold his station' would.

Quote:  run: [1] This word has several uses but the most common refers to a stretch of work. The official shearing time of two hours is called a `run'. The day is divided into four of these. 7.30am-9.30am, smoke-o; 10.00am-12 noon, dinner; 1.00pm-3.00pm smoke-o; 3.30pm-5.30pm, tea.  [2] Also another name for a sheep station.  [3] Also the contract circuit. A shearing contractor will arrange a `run' of sheds for his gang each season.

When a ship lay at anchor, most of the crew would go ashore and an `anchor watch' would be left aboard. Very often, some thirsty soul ... would `borrow' the cutter and slip ashore for rum ... This was `running the cutter'. Later, in days when some areas were under prohibition, the term was used for the job of going to the nearest licensed hotel for liquor. ... And the driver comes in and breasts up to the bar./ He says, `Give me a jar and a couple of crates,/ For I am running the cutter tonight for me mates!'/... `We are fresh out of beer,/So that's why I'm here,/ Running the cutter tonight./

When I first read this inscription [in the Memorial Church, Cave], the word `sheep-men' made me involuntarily flinch. Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.' The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ... [12] Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `runholder' was the most used, and it is the word that I think should be substituted.

Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.'  The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ... [12] Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `runholder' was the most used, and it is the word that I think should be substituted.

Quote:  Another kind of weatherboard which became popular in the 1880‘s was the "rusticated" board, where the top edge was planed down to fit behind a rebate in the edge of the next board. The completed wall showed pronounced grooves which resembled channel-jointed stonework, and in more elaborate houses timber <i>quoins</i> at corners assisted the illusion. The introduction of the rusticated board has been attributed to the Wellington architect Julius Toxward in the 1860s.

The mercury itself became `sick' or `floured'; both sodium and nitric acid were employed to improve its amalgamating qualities.
