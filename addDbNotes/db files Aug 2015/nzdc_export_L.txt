Quote: On account of the fibrous nature of [<i> Plagianthus Lyallii'</i> s] inner bark, it is popularly known in the Middle Island as one of the `Ribbon Wood' or `Lace Bark' trees, as is the  Hoheria populnea, and its varieties in the Northern Island. <i>Ibid.</i> 55 Hoheria... It is asserted that at one time "Lace-bark" bonnets were quite fashionable in Nelson... HOHERIA POPULNEA (<i> A.Cunn.</i>) ... The `HOUI' or `WHAU-WHI'.- ... grows abundantly in both Islands... Owing to the chaste [snow-white] appearance of its flowers, it has not inaptly been termed by some the `New Zealand orange Blossom'. The inner bark is peculiar, and consists of layer upon layer of laced fibre, ...From this peculiarity it is called by the settlers the `Thousand Jacket', `lace-bark', or `Ribbon-wood'.

It can be deep enough to drown in, or shallow enough to be merely an overloaded swamp ( ), or `sheet of water', or can even have no water ( ). It can be of some square miles (see Lake Grassmere) or small as a pond; early NZ uses follow this standard sense: get geog. as well as temporal coverage.

Quote: Derek Parsons, of Westport, wants to know the derivation of the verb lair up, which he hears used by people planning a party... Lair has a long history.... As the centuries passed it became a sideways look or leer, producing leery as a synonym for distrustful, still in proper use today. Moving right along, leery became lairy, meaning flashy, eventually producing lair for a person who dresses in a vulgar, exhibitionist style. Properly, to lair up is to dress in this style. If you want to have a sleazy party you should use lair it up.

Quote: Ages of sheep. Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

He does not wash his sheep before shearing, but he washes; and, most marvellous of all, it is not his sheep which lamb, but he `lambs down' himself.

Quote: A specific charge was laid against Burke of what is classically known as `lambing down,' a common enough business in the olden days but little heard of now, except in the backblocks of Australia after shearing. The process is simplicity itself. A shearer comes along with a chequefor 80 or 100 [pounds], gives it to the publican, gets rapidly drunk, and then drunker, and then  D.T.'s and then wakes up and goes back into the never-never to rake up another cheque. For a publican in these enlightened days to be accused of this kind of business is a very serious thing,...

Quote: BROAD-LEAVED PLANTAIN (<I>Plantago major </I>), also called ratstail, birdseed, lamb's tongue, and greater plantain, is common on roadsides and trodden places throughout the country and in pastures in the King Country. ... From the middle of the rosette ascends the flower stalk ... , which afterwards give[s] place to seeds, and produce[s] the ratstail appearance that gives the plant one of its trivial names. The long spikes of seed pods are often used for feeding caged birds. ... PLANTAIN (Plantago lanceolata) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass'. From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie'-that is `Charles and George'- a souvenir of 1745.

Quote:  The fame of the West Coaster's `own' garment for outdoor workers - the ubiquitous miner's `lammie' - has spread far afield. This week a trial parcel of lammies was dispatched on request to members of the Malayan Police Force at Singapore who indicated in a letter to the Kumara firm which has made a specialty of supplying lammies since the gold rush days that they had heard of the unique qualities of the garment. The full story of the request from Singapore is not known, but it is believed that Auckland Chinese market gardeners may have been responsible. For many years Chinese gardeners have adopted the lammie as almost an `official uniform' and supplies for Auckland are regularly forwarded from the small business in Kumara. But what is a lammie? In the first place it is a strictly utilitarian garment with no claims to attractiveness in appearance. The original type - still in use after 70 years - was a loose-fitting almost shapeless shirt buttoned in front and with elbow-length sleeves made of flannel and water-proofed. It is this proofing quality which has established the popularity of the lammie. It was an ideal garment for outdoor workers in the West Coast climate, enabling them to keep drywithout the encumbrance of an overcoat and it was soon in general use on the gold fields, later to be adopted by bushworkers, navvies and many farmers. At first the lammie was made of moleskin, then grey flannel and over the past 20 years of navy flannel, but the proofing formula has remained unchanged. In recent years there has also been developed a modified style, double breasted Coast fashion, but the original shirt style is still popular. Apart from the fact that the historic gold-mining town of Kumara is regarded as the home of the lammie in New Zealand, the story of its origin has been lost. It is thought, however, that it was probably brought to the goldfields by the first Welsh diggers and that it may have been spelt `Llamy.' It was soon almosta universal garment among diggers, including big contingents of Chinese miners who found it ideal both for utility and for economy.

Mr. had a sluicing claim, and a draper named Todd used to get special flannel by the bolt for Mrs. Tait, and she made these `lammies.' She waterproofed them by dipping them in a special solution two or three times and hanging them on a line dripping wet, to dry each time. They were sold for 2 [pounds] 10/- to 2 [pounds] 15/- but I'm sure she never sold one to a Chinaman. There were  hundreds there working tailings. It was Mrs. Tait's own invention I am sure. - I am, etc.,

Their social as well as legal importance is considerable, but the terms do not appear in any general dictionary.  They are seldom encountered today, simply because the land transfer system has become to all intents and purposes the sole conveyancing system in New Zealand. In Australia the same system is known as the Torrens system after its South Australian originator.

Quote: `Clips', `keps', or landing chairs: A solid, dead flush, landing platform for the cages was required at each level and at the surface for getting full trucks in and out of cages. This platform was provided by a steel frame mounted on heavy bearers two or three feet below the level of the chamber floor so that it could be tilted into the shaft by a lever and make a strong support beneath the cages. It was balanced by a counterweight to make it easy to operate. To ensure that the two cages in the shaft worked exactly opposite each other when the chamberman `changed gear' to wind ore from a different level, he rang the change signal of five bells on the steel-wire knocker-line suspended in the shaft compartment, and the engine-driver placed the `free' cage on the surface `clips' (or `keps') and disengaged it on the engine drive-shaft. The chamberman then  signalled to lift the `fast' cage on the level where he was working just clear of the clips, and pinned these back clear of the shaft. He entered the `fast' cage and rang the number of the level to which he wished to change, and was taken there by the driver. On arrival at the level he placed the clips in position in the shaft and rang the change signal, whereupon the driver placed the `fast' cage on the clips and put the `free' cage (which was sitting on the surface clips) in gear on the engine drive-shaft. Thus, when the cage was raised from the level to the surface, the cage from the surface would be exactly at the level from which the winding was taking place. Great care had always to be taken to ensure that the clips were not left protruding into the shaft as a serious accident could result if the cage crashed into them.

A landing service consists, basically, of a large shed on shore from which a slipway leads down into the water. <i>Ibid.</i> 7 In 1870-71, the first part of the Landing Service Building was erected by Peter McRae, owner of the nearby Club Hotel, and leased by him to the Landing Service Co.

It took on most of the connotation of land-shark. qv. The Bay of Islands and Auckland saw much early private speculation in land.

He is essentially colonial, English cities may have `gamins` and the Pacific Slope can boast of `hoodlums` ... Though everybody speaks and writes about the `larrikin', what is he? ... I  presume, I may say, he is of the male sex and that his age ranges from 12 to 21. He is oftown origin. His amusements are various. He likes to be in the streets, and rather prefers to be about theatres. Smoking is his pastime. As to his actions the larrikins may be classed under two headings: 1) The mischievous larrikin 2) the criminal larrikin.

Quote: Lar´.ri-kin (l&abreve.r´.r&ibreve.´.k&ibreve.n), n. [Cf. prov. Eng. larrick lively, careless, larack to frolic, to romp. See Note below] 1. A street blackguard; a rowdy.  2. A hobbledehoy inclined to rough horseplay and practical joking. 3. In a general sense, an ill-bred or low-minded person; - often used merely as a contemptuous epithet.  4. A neglected boy who frequents the streets; a street Arab; a gutter snipe. Marcus Clarke.  In senses 1 and 2 this word has become common inEngland. Larrikin is thought to have come into use about 1870. Its origin, though much disputed, is commonly explained by the following anecdote : An Irish policeman at Melbourne, on bringing a notorious rough into court, was asked by the magistrate what the prisoner had been doing, and replied, "He was  a-larriki' [i. e., a-larking] about the streets." This story lacks confirmation, but the word may not improbably be connected with  lark to frolic, to which, indeed, the Prov. Eng. larrick and larrack are perhaps related.

Quote: The word has various shades of meaning between a playful youngster and a blackguardly rough. Little street-boys are often in a kindly way called little larrikins. (See quotations), 1870 and 1885.) Archibald Forbes described the larrikin as `a cross between the Street Arab and Hoodlum, with a dash of the Rough thrown in to improve the mixture.` (`Century.') The mostexalted position yet reached in liteature by this word is in Sir Richard Burton's Translation of the Arabian Nights' (1886-7), vol. i. p. 4,  Story of the larrikin and the Cook; vol. iv. p. 281, Tale of First Larrikin. The previous translator, Jonathan Scott, had rendered the Arabic word, Sharper. -->There are three views as to the origin of the word, viz.-->(I) That it is a phonetic spelling of the broad Irish pronunciation, with a trilled rof the word larking). The story goes that a certain Sergeant Dalton, about the year 1869, charged a youthful prisoner at the Melbourne Police Court with being ` a-larrr-akin' about the streets.` The police Magistrate, Mr Sturt, did not quite catch the word- `A what, Sergeant?` -`A larrikin', your Worchup.` The police court reporter used the word the next day in the paper, and it stuck. (see quotation, `Argus,' 1896.)  This story is believed by 99 persons out of 100: unfortunately it lacks confirmation; for the record of theincident cannot be discovered after long search in files by many people. Mr Skeat's warning must be remembered - -->`As a rule, derivations which require a story to be told turn out to be false.` -->(2) That the word is thieves' English, promoted like swag, plant, lift, etc., into ordinary Australian English. Warders testify that for a number of years before the word appeared in print, it was used among criminals in gaol as two separate words,  viz. leary('cute, fly, knowing), and kinchen(youngster),  `learykinchenshortened commonly into `leary-kin' and leary kid'. Australian wardens and constables are Irish, almost to a man. Their pronunciation of `leary kin' would be very nearly `lairy kin,' which becomes the single word  larrikin. (See quotation, 1871.) It is possible that Sergeant Dalton used this expression and was misunderstood by the reporter. (3) The word has been derived from the French larron  (a thief), which is from the Latin latronem (a robber).  This became in English larry, to which the English  diminutive, kinwas added; although this etymology is always derided in Melbourne.

When I was a small boy, these shrieks gave me the creeps. I thought they sounded as if all the demons had got loose and were trying to frighten us, and I was always very thankful that there was someone nearby to protect me. I have not heard any of these birds for over thirty years, and presume that the stoats and weasels have accounted for them.

Notes: Jim writes : In relation to places this is much the most common use of the word in NZ. Not in DNZE or - in this sense - NZPOD but recognised in NZ Oxford Paperback. NSOD defines <i>laundry</i> as an establishment where clothes etc are laundered, Collins as a place where clothes and linen are washed and ironed, which encompasses the NZ use but is unspecified. In most modern houses in England clothes are washed in the kitchen and there is no separate room. In NZ until recently bylaws prohibited washing clothes in a room used for preparing food. <i>Laundry</i> is known in England in the NZ sense but seems uncommon. In a 1987 Property supplement to a Midlands newspaper it rarely appeared in the detailed house descriptions and always as an attributive - <i>laundry area, laundry room</i>. The term <i>laundry room</i> appears in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> 2000. The Australian situation (and word) was similar to the NZ one according to Hudson <i>Modern Australian usage</i>. MAU p223. Macquarie 1981 is consistent with this. Salmond  <i>Old NZ Houses</i>p. 200 suggests that the change of name from wash-house to laundry was associated with the advent of the bungalow style i.e. c1910-1920. Cf <i>porch</i>. But see <i>wash-house</i>. The same book implies (anachronistically?) a possible much earlier use  "Until the 1880s... water was heated... in the laundry copper for washing clothes and for the children's weekly bath." p. 143. Two house plans (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 198-99) are of interest. One dated 1930 has a "washhouse" under the same roof as the house; the other dated 1924 has a basement "laundry".

Quote: It comprised a series of good terraces around about 1,500 to 1,800 feet and a big stretch of steep nor'-west facings which was about the first country on the place to clear after snow. However it had one big drawback for hoggets - it was bad with `lawyers'.  A `lawyer', perhaps I should explain, is a dense bushy plant characterised by thousands and thousands of hooklike barbs along every inch of its creeper-like branches and tentacles.  ...How the plant came to get the name of Lawyer I don't know, but it is commonly said that, like those gentlemen of the legal profession, once they get their hooks into you, you've had it.

Quote: Various species of <i> Rubus </i>, a briar-like plant which is a nuisance to men in the bush. It also grows on moist or shady hillsides in the open and is a great danger to hoggets, as they get caught up in it. When growing in the open it is often called a <i> l.-bush </i>.  Except in Potts's `Out in the Open', to the best of my knowledge  a <i> b.l.</i> has always meant an argumentative fellow. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) [Lawyer = `briar` is recorded as English from the sixteenth century. The reason for the name is obvious.--A.W.]

The Corrections Department was the only other government department in double figures, hiring 13 leased executives at a total cost of $1.05 million... Agencies should avoid leased staff being used in roles where they will be the public face of the agency - either internally or externally - over an extended period... The department had 41 leased contracts, 38 of which were in the IT areas... Generally, to source and retain these people the department has had to enter into leased contracts.

Quote: A dodge by owners that should have been worked out ages ago is the legging up of unfashionable horsemen when they want a horse stopped, and then, later on, when they want to back him, they put up a `big gun.' It is manifestly unfair to the boys, but the latter are compelled to `hook 'em' as they get so little riding that four quid is often very handy to them.

Quote: In the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (In more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in  which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop,Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

The councillors were nominated by the Governor, in this respect resembling the old nominee system. They held their seats for life. As showing the fear and detestation in which the word `nominee' was held, Mr. Fox and others who assisted in passing the measure viewed the relating clauses as the great blots of the Act.

Quote: At Macfarlane's the men saddled fresh horses and rode in some cattle which we had a great bother to yard, as everything was new ... The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiringbranding, and after hauling them up to a corner post, leg-roped and threw them on [44] their side, placing a long lever on their neck and under the lowest rail so that they would not move much ... When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb  the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.

Quote: A mystery Immigration Srvice official.. is still under investigation by secretary of labour James Buwalda, who announced on Thursday he had sacked communications manager Ian Smith over the "lie in unison" memo. The investigation followed controversy about Mr Smith's handling of information relating to asylum seeker Ahmed Zaoui and a comment he made on an internal memo, suggesting staff had conspired to lie in response to inquiries about the case... However, no one else would be disciplined over the "lie in unison" memo and that matter was final.

I have, of course, often heard the argument that the run-out cannot be judged until the dog has lifted his sheep. In other words, provided the sheep turn directly towards the man when `lifted', the dog has finished his head correctly regardless of whether it is short or otherwise. <i>Ibid.</i> 168 (Glossary) Lift: When a dog has completed his head his next job is quietly to start them on the `pull'. This, the first movement in the pull, is known as the lift. To pull is to bring the sheep back to the man.

The introduction of a summer running train, which took advantage of the daylight, was also ‘limited in its accommodation'... It brought about a desire for more specific titles, so "Daylight Limited" and "Night Limited" became the terms commonly used in referring to them.

There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop,Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

Quote: It was at this time [c1851], that the smart and appropriate sobriquet of the `Little Enemy' was  affixed to a small but obstructive body of gentlemen in the community, mostly of standing and intelligence, and supporters of Sir George Grey. English and Episcopalian, they were viewed as intruders ... and reciprocated by seeing in the special scheme of the settlement and its leaders all that was narrow and intolerant. In a superior way they stood aloof from the rest, and their attitude was one of opposition. ... No quarter was given, no consideration shown on either side. The advent of the beneficent constitution finally ended these bickerings ... and though the term `Little Enemy' clung long, it was rather as a memory than a badge.

The name White-throated Shag is also in general use for the most abundant phase of a rather variable species which, at its other extreme, is identical with the Little Pied Shag of Australia. However, as intermediates occur, and the Little Pied form is relatively uncommon, it seems more convenient to treat the New Zealand population as a variable one under a distinctive name.

loaf
Homonym Number:
Word Class:noun
Sense Number:
Definition:In esp. NI towns, the standard `loaf' size was usually the two-pound, with a half-loaf being a pound. In country districts, esp. in the South Island, the standard loaf size was usually four-pound; with a half-loaf, two-pound, and a quarter-loaf, one pound. `Tourists' and holiday makers from towns were and are often thus confused when ordering country bread: the town's `half' was the country's `quarter' loaf.

Quote: <i>bread</i>: It comes in standard-sized loaves (government regulation). 350g (about 12 oz), 500g (about 1 lb), 700g (about 1 and a half lb). Unfortunately, common parlance for these loaves differs between the North and South islands. Many of the 700g loaves are made like a camel with two so that they can conveniently be split in half. Usually, if you ask for a loaf in the South Island it is one of these two humps (350g) that you get. In the North Island, if you want the same amount of bread (350g) you must ask for a half loaf. The other thing about bread, is that in this land of abundant food, where restaurant servings are usually generous, it is very hard to get more than one piece of bread (or one roll). Unlike North America, where they seem to hope you will settle for smaller servings if you fill up with bread, in New Zealand restaurants appear afraid that you will spoil your appetite with the stuff.

Quote: Lodgepole pine, <i>Pinus contorta</i>, is a relative of the familiar radiata pine... In the south-eastern Kaweka Ranges contorta has marched across the southern ridges, shading out many species, and in places is so thick that pushing through it has become virtually impossible. Each year, the Department of Conservation tackles areas of contorta for removal, but it is an ongoing and expensive battle. In the eastern South Island ,there is no control, and contorta threatens to change tussockland into exotic forests.

Notes: (further from Dalley's article 10) The lolly shops and tobacconists behind which some one-woman brothels operated were more than a convenient facade or 'legitimate' reason for men to gather. Many of the one-woman brothel keepers ran their front shops, as well as their prostitution trade, as regular business enterprises, selling merchandise as any other retailer would. The association between the legitimate frontage and the activity in the back rooms also reflected what Ann-Louise Shapiro has termed the 'polymorphous world of commerce and sexuality' which infused urban life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

On February 10, 1916, Truth published an article entitled 'A Grave Problem, Vile Disease and Dreadful Truth' about the so called 'lolly shops' in Cambridge Tce that were actually facades for brothels... Dalley has investigated the existence of these lolly shops, which were legitimate after a law was passed in 1908 that allowed prostitutes to operate from brothels providing they didn't employ anyone else... During World War I troops from Trentham came into town and lined up outside the shop... Particularly because it was opposite the Queen Victoria statue - it became known as Gallipoli.

Quote: There are five standard classes [in dog trialling], each incorporating three events. The standard classes are as follows: Class I (the Long Pull); Class II (the Drive and Yard); Class IIA (a SouthIsland event); Class III (the Zig-zag or Slew) and Class IV (The Straight Hunt.) The three events in each class are: The maiden, for dogs which have not won a maiden event; the Intermediate, open only to dogs which have won a maiden but have not won an open; and lastly, the open itself. The standard events are usually held on hill courses.

The Hawke's Bay Regional Council installed the recorder as part of a study by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research into long waves that turn up on the East Coast. .. Scientist Derek Goring said the long waves, which came at intervals of seven to 11 minutes, were the bane of port operators and ship owners at open coast ports such as Napier, Gisborne, Timaru and, to a lesser extent, Lyttelton. .. Scientists want to know why, and how often, long waves turned up, so they could provide more-informed warning procedures. .. While a lot of work had still to be done, he hoped the research would allow NIWA to predict when the long waves would occur.

Quote: (Griffiths Collection) [in Aug 1975 it was used on TV1 without explanation] A television news item about the visit to Stewart Island by the Prime Minister (Mr Rowling) referred to the islanders' word for tourists, `loopys.' An islander has told the `Southland Times' that the word originated in another corner of Southland, Milford Sound, about 1970. `The name was coined by hotel staff who appeared to have a great contempt for `loopys',' said the islander. `It refers to the peculiar looping motion of the hand while swatting sandflies and to the `loopy' questions they ask.'

Quote:  In the same Listener Aucklander Geoff Chapple, last heard of hiding behind a bush off the Heaphy Track, wondered why the South Island word for tourists is `loopies'. (At first he thought it was `loonies'.) We thought it must have come from `loopy', meaning wrong in the head, but sources in the southern heartland assure us that the term almost certainly derivesfrom tourists' propensity for taking the loop road in any given area, with the general idea of seeing more of the countryside. How diverting.

I quickly scanned the article to see if `loopy' meant what I thought it did. ... One of the words used by Mr Chapman was `loup', from the Norse `hlaupa' meaning `leap'. Orkney residents would describe tourists as `loupers', meaning `leapers', presumably because they jumped from place to place.

The cut was becoming rougher and numbers spoilt good work, and slowly the gore of the classer, the shepherds, and certainly that of William Steuart, rose...  Conferences would be held, a slight glistening on the fibre of the fleece, when sunlight decreed `wet sheep' and then the shearers would declare a break, whilst the `loppies', paid wet or fine, would be put on varying jobs to fill in the time until the Lords and Masters of the situation agreed to work. <i>Ibid.</i> 50 The bell rang, the whole procedure stopped, shearers trooped out, half shorn sheep were pushed back into the catching pens. Jimmy Greave the classer hurriedly whispered to William Steuart todesist, but loppies, rousies, and even young Jim, who was assisting to pen up, followed out from the side door to where the shoots from the stands gave the nearest exit, to the level space of the outside turf, that made eventually the [boxing] ring.

Notes: Jim Cameron writes : OED defines the word as "a set of furniture of the same pattern, frequently with reference to 2 armchairs and a sofa". NSOD & Collins define the word in this sense as "esp. of 2 armchairs and a settee." NZPOD following English POD gives "a sofa and armchairs of the same design." This is usually called a <i>lounge suite</i> in NZ, a term not recorded in the British dictionaries. The NZ use of suite ordinarily encompasses also a <i>dining suite</i> and a <i>bedroom suite</i>. (I have seen bedroom suite used in an English mystery novel published a few years ago). See furniture store ads in any newspaper or circular. In NZ, the meaning of <i>suite</i> by itself would be uncertain except in context.

The common name, ribbonwood, was given by the early settlers because of the tree's inner, ribbon-like bark. These layers are very tough and were once used by Maoris for making rope and twine for fishing nets.

There was slots, there was lumps, there was packing fragies in bottlos, there was the tying down of the north line for a clearance, the scissors, lead seals and squeezers. The sorters on call-back flicking circulars withprecision. The volcanoes of letters on the facing-up table, the checker chanting the reds onto the lorry, the checker calling the overseas in, London 45 ... The queue of men working at the parcel depot or the postal siding ... Tieing down the cargon. ... The sorters' school at the posties' pub known colloquially as Box 44 or the B.B.C., the Back Bar of the Cecil. The cheerful abuse of cobbers.
