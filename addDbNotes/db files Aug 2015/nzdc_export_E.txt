Quote: From an article First Echelon Reunion by Arthur Helm. The use of the word `echelon' in the sense of First, Second or Third Echelon has puzzled many people, for though it is a military term it does not normally denote a `contingent.' Echelon refers to the position of an army in the form of steps or parallel lines ... A new name was sought for Second World War soldiers, and `echelon' was the word chosen. It was first used in this context on August 29, 1939 ... While in the Middle East - in September 1940 - an attempt was made to alter it to `contingent,' but thiswas not successful, and `echelon' it remained.

Quote: Nevertheless, [pitching games] had their place [in the play of new Zealand children], and most important of all was undoubtedly  Egg Cap (K-21), known also as Egg in Cap, Egg in the Nest, Egg Cup, Rotten Egg, and Mingle the Bonnets. It was a pitching, chasing, and ball-tagging game in which a ball was pitched into school caps or holes in the ground. Fortunately the game is still played at Alexandra, Central Otago, and has been recorded in some detail. [Holes or `nests' are 6 inches apart.] ... (Naseby, Otago, 1900; Nelson, 1875; Dunedin, 1885)

Definition:In NZ the general English interjectional interrogative particle often inviting assent (OED2 2. `Wasn't it lucky, eh?'), and possibly the interrogative use as a request for the repetition or explanation of something that has just been said (OED2 3 colloq. or vulgar `Eh? What's that, Sackville?), possibly reinforced in some areas by a use of the Maori interrogative n&emacr. produces a typical and frequent form: positive statement +  particle eh? or eh! You're going to town, eh(?)  J. Devanny Old Savage 1927 uses both the general English (negative) and the NZ (positive) use as part of her style (check pages 104 `aye'). Cf 1943 Bennett English in NZ 91 In the mild imperative with  eh - as in `Give us a packet of cigarettes, eh' - it is tempting to see a reflexion of that egalitarianism that frequently strikes the visitor (who misses the respectful`sir').

These vernacular names are given by fishermen on account of the fish benumbing or paralysing the person who unwittingly grasps one with his hands. The last name is from the somewhat similar shape to that of a skate or ray, ray being another common term for skates and also the scientific family name. </i>

Quote: `Emigrant' and `Colonist' are used by some as simply convertible terms; though the life of every settler compared with itself, the condition of every colony, refute the mistake. Others, who are aware of the great difference that exists between the two, are yet very far from knowing wherein it consists. They sometimes speak of emigrants ... and colonists as two distinct classes, or rather, castes of men. One who flies from his native land driven by want ... who sets his life on a venture because it is worth so little ... these are Emigrants; while farmers, tradesmen, gentlefolks, those who have something, ... all, in short, who can make up a purse full enough to depart respectably, ... all who have prospects however distant; these are Colonists. I remember well on board the Charlotte Jane on the voyage out to New Zealand, certain friends of mine always called the common passengers - `the emigrants'. Evidently they considered themselves in all respects above the condition of `emigrants.' ... emigrant a term of reproach.

Originally the title of a solo stage play, it has passed into our language, lodged there by the man who wrote the play and performed it all over the country for the best part of two decades - the great writer and actor Bruce Mason.

I consider the stunted, ill-natured herbage of the better English grasses is less palatablethan the young, fresh herbage of the second rate species. <i>Ibid.</i>166 The early settlers of a  century ago introduced to New Zealand various `English' grasses and clovers to supplement and later to replace the native grasses on the average-to-superior soil types.

There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.

Quote: Finn and Judd became the creative impetus behind the first incarnation of Split Enz, perhaps New Zealand's most recognisable rock group... Instead of using the band's 1985 recording with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, known as ENZSO, as a starting point, Balwin opted for a much more raw approach to convey in dance the Enz times... Baldwin likens the Enz approach to that taken by Igor Stravinsky - a composer he says had the reputation of being a classical music magpie.

Quote: In the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (In more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.
