Quote:  The most widely known game with insects is a game named variously by T.C. students as Butcher Boys (Gisborne, New Plymouth, Kaponga, [405] Te Pohu, Newall, Sth. Wellington), Butcher Bats (Ohau, Takaka), Penny Doctor Beetles (Tauranga, Pipiriki, Rotorua), or Fishing (Morunui). It is a game in which straws which have been suitably moistened with spittle are placed in an insects [sic] hole and are flicked out when the insect bites the end of the straw. Most of the reports of this practice come from the North Island, though it was known in the South as early as 1900 (Waikouaiti).

The flow then passes over blanket tables, which arrest mechanically all the heavier particles. <i>Ibid.</I> 179 The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

If you ever wonder what drivers are picking up or unloading on the end of a curved piece of wood, it is the tablet or biscuit. A train cannot get through a section of rail without the biscuit matching the one in the red metal box, which is connected to the manually operated signals. Automatic signals are phasing this system in to rural museums.

At their best, Taewa are a flavoursome root vegetable in colours ranging from purples to reds and yellows, which are traditionally boiled or steamed... [The research] builds on a number of other research projects already carried out into Taewa, which have helped identify four cultivars... These are called Tutaekuri, Kowiniwiri aka Karuparera, Moemoe and Huakaroro.

The urenika  variety, with its bright purple flesh and skin, and the kowiniwini, with its purple and cream skin, would look a treat on any restaurant table.... It was probable the taewa arrived by ship in the mid to late 18th century and had become established by the time of the major settlement about 1840... Northland's Ngati Hine people have identified the Maori varieties karoro, peruperu, uwhiwhero, kowiniwini and urenika as possible pre-European varities.

Both were intelligible to many English speakers up to at least the 1930s, and possibly the 1950s in the North Island, as witness the following joke first heard by me as a child in Havelock (South Island) possibly from an original King Country version; and first mentioned as early as 1845 by Walter Brodie in <i>The State of New Zealand </i>where it is attributed to Mr [?initial] Williams.

Tim and Paddy were walking along the beach when they came across two Maoris arguing, as it semed to them, ferociously. One was crying out `Tie Tim!' and the other, `Tie Paddy!'. Paddy took to his heels shouting: `You can bloody well tie Tim if you like, but I'm damned if you'll tie Paddy!' Enjoyment of the joke depends not only on knowing the meaning of the Maori forms, but also on a non-Maori perception of Maori /r/ as [d], and failure to hear a devocalised /u/ final. In 1986 it is usually necessary to `prepare' the joke with tedious explanation.

Quote:  TAIAHA A weapon, superficially like a broad-hafted spear, but actually a broadsword. It is made of hardwood, with the `point' of the blade rounded, the edges sharp, and a carved, pointed tongue where the hilt would be on European broadsword. It is wielded in a manner that has something of the two-handed sword, the quarterstaff and the modern rifle-and-bayonet combination. The carved tongue is decorated where it joins the blade, with a collar of dog-hair.

Quote:  "Taihoa" does not mean careful

consideration, prudent and wise

advancement, careful deliberation,

putting on the brake, chewing things

over, although it may be used for these

reasons.  English-ised, this word

corresponds to our own adverb 'by-and-

by'- postponing indefinitely for any

reason or for no reason at all what may

be said or done at once.  It has always

meant this and can never mean anything

else, whether applied to the occasional

or habitual procrastinations of a pakeha,Maori chief, or honourable

Parliamentarian grievously pestered by

urgent petitions of insatiate

constitutents.

Quote:  Suppose a piece of timber - a flitch nine inches by twenty-four and sixteen feet long - is on the carriage, and that we intend cutting nine by three-quarter boards. After taking off a `face' cut, setting the gauger rollers, and placing the flitch in position, the man at the head starts the machinery. `Kreash,' says the saw. and in twelve seconds she is out at the other end. The man at the `tail' at that instant reverses the motion of the table, which gigs back.

Quote:  The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

Since they have become Christians, however, they have called it by another name, Te whare Taipo (the Devil's house), probably referring the formation of the cave, of which I shall speak more fully in the geological part of my report, to supernatural agency rather than to the hand of nature.

Quote:  a New Zealand word for devil, often applied by settlers to a vicious horse or as a name for a dog. There is a dangerous river, the Taipo, on the west coast. There is considerable dispute as to whether the word is true Maori or not. The Rev. T. G. Hammond of Patea says -

-->`No such Maori word as taipo, meaning devil, exists. It would mean evening-tide - tai-po. Probably the early sailors introduced attached meaning of devil from the Maori saying, `Are you not afraid to travel at night?' referring to the danger of tidal rivers.' -->On the hand, Mr. Tregear says, in his `Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v. - -->`Taepo, a goblin, a spectre. C.f. <I>tae</I>, to arrive; <I>po</I>, night.' The Rev. W. Colenso says, in his pamphlet on `Nomenclature' (1883), p. 5 - -->`Taepo means to visit or come by night, - a night visitant, - a spectral thing seen in dreams, - a fancied and feared thing, or hobgoblin, of the night or darkness; and this the settlers have construed to mean the Devil! - and of course their own orthodox one.'

Terapuhi was still shaking with fear, but gradually he recovered and said, `Tae-po does sometimes come like that, and not do any harm, but I told you this is a bad place.' <I>Ibid.</I>96 Tae-po, an evil spirit, from the verb <I>tae</I>, to arrive, and <I>po</I>, night or darkness. An evil nocturnal visitor, incorrectly (as a rule), put as one word, Taipo, which is of course meaningless.

Quote:  <I>taipo,</I> supernatural being; goblin: used by the Maori believing it to be Pakeha, and by the Pakeha believing it to be Maori; often spelt taepo, which also is not a Maori word: so taipo is a word coined by no one knows whom... <I>taipo</I>, see the remarks following the word in list 2. There is a Maori remark that may be quoted here: Haere ra! E tama E! Mou te tai ata, moku te tai po (Farewell! O son! lit. Yours the morning tide, mine the evening tide, meaning You pass with the morning tide, as I will pass by the evening tide). The saying was often used in war, when a man saw a young relative or friend slain; and the words were often prophetic of his own fate. The meaning is quite destroyed if the last two words are run together - taipo instead of tai po: that results in the word under discussion, making the meaning: You pass on the morning tide, while I go to the devil! - naturally a modern interpretation. A Pakeha using the expression once confused that last words and made them taepa; when it meant: You pass on the morning tide, while I get over the fence. So near is the approach of the ridiculous to the sublime.

what are often referred to as the

Cornwall Cup boats. They owe their

existence to a small band of Takapuna

yachtsmen who planned the first boat,

with much the same idea in their minds as

did George Honour when he built the first

of the 14-foot square bilge boats,

namely, low first cost, ease of

construction, and an ever-watchful eye on

speed and performance under Auckland

harbour weather conditions.  The yachts

were originally designed for the Takapuna

Boating Club but owing to their

popularity from the outset the type was

quickly adopted by many other yacht clubs

throughout New Zealand... From small

beginnings the Takapuna one-design  class

rapidly expanded.

Quote:  The Z class, or "Zeddie" as it was

affectionately known, was another class

which was designed as a low cost sailing

boat to get the boys into something safer

than the tin canoes or derelict dinghies

in which they cruised Shoal Bay. Ibid.

114 The Takapuna Boating Club which was

then situated at Bayswater, was the

sponsoring club and the yachts were often

referred to as the "Takapuna Class".

Quote:  Down the generations it had been observed that this happened about the same time each year, so the wise old chiefs set the season for the `take' for that certain time of the year which became known to the pakeha as half of March, all of April and May, allowing no trespassing on the island at any other time of the year lest the birds, refusing to nest on an island `touched' by human presence, should fly away and never return. <i>Ibid.</I> 27 Especially when the pakeha took a Maori wife; he could then share her journey to her island, and help her to `take' enough birds for their family needs. <i>Ibid.</I> 39 Some of these descendants actually visited the disputed islands and attempted to `take'. <.i>Ibid.</I> 55-56 Ever since the beginning, to `take' meant journeying to the islands and living there for the season and using hands or any device to catch the birds. ... to `take' also includes an `attempt to take'. During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path. If one pursues a bird and grabs it over the other edge of the path one can be prosecuted, even although the bird came from the pursuer's manu. <i>Ibid.,</I> 66 In the season 1921 the Colac Bay and Riverton Maoris caught 24,000 birds, In 1922 the `take' was 14,000.

Quote:  Tamariki, Tamarikitanga - children were traditionally openly cared for, and shared particularly by both parents and grandparents; they had the advantage of being able to expect similar care and protection from not just close kin, but other parents within the hapu (larger kinship group). They were encouraged to become independent and responsible as quickly as possible. One detrimental effect of urbanisation on the economic realities of today is the breakdown evident in such caring.

Quote:  The tamarillo, it seems, is still a fruit New Zealand has largely to itself, for though it is grown in private gardens around the world in warm frost-free places like California, South Africa, Asia and Africa, only here is it cultivated systematically on a commercial scale... In the 1880s, Mr D Morris, director of the Botanbical Gardens in Jamaica, sent seeds to the hill districts of India and Sri Lanka, and it was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, to Hay and Sons, nurserymen of Parnell in Auckland. The Hay's 1891-1892 catalogue states that the nursery then had "plants of strong and healthy appearance" for sale... The name "tamarillo" officially came into being on January 31, 1967, after New Zealand exporters decided a more romantic, exotic name was needed than "tree tomato". The strategy worked, and today tamarillo seems to have become the accepted name internationally.

Quote:  Although it sounds Spanish, the name ‘tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name ‘tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word ‘tama' added ‘tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced ‘t' with an ‘r'. Thus, ‘tamarillo' was born.

Quote:  Supplies of tropical fruits were curtailed because of the Japanese threats to the sea lanes, and tamarillo (or tree tomato as they were then known) growing began in earnest. [WWII] <i>Ibid.</I> 141 An uncultivated native of the Andes region of Peru, the tamarillo is also found wild in India, Sri Lanka and parts of South East Asia. It was from the hilly regions of northern India that New Zealand's first seeds came, introduced by the Auckland nursery of D. Hay and Sons in 1891. At first only the yellow and purple varieties were grown and it was not until the end of World War I that the now almost universal red variety was bred at Mangere, Auckland.

Quote:  Two well-known New Zealand exports, neither of them native, are tree-tomatoes and Chinese gooseberries, but neither is called that by the exporters. The tomatoes are a South American fruit, a rich source of vitamin C and long popular in New Zealand. About twenty years ago, the name <i>tamarillo</i> was deliberately contrived, much as a brand name is. On the basis of <i>tomato</i>, a diminutive<i> -ill-</i> was added; then <i>tomatillo</i> was altered, in honor of a legendary Maori tribal hero, Tama-te-kapua, to <i>tamatillo</i>; and then a change to <i>tamarillo</i> was considered more euphonious. And so a new word was born.

-->A. The original Maori adjectival use is recorded in early English texts(as is the substantival), translated as `native' COPPER MAORI (q.v.) would fall within this use (contrast MAORI COPPER), as would PAKEHA MAORI. -->[J.C. Andersen Maori Names p.30 notes "<i>Korari Maori</i>: Here McCrae uses the word Maori in its usual sense signifying `normal, usual, ordinary. Not until long after this time did the word come to mean what Euopeans assume it actually means, and in which the natives themselves now aquiesce - that is the name of the people, the New Zealanders. It had no such meaning in the mind of the natives until a comparatively recent date, nor was it apparently so used by them to any extent until about 1850, though Wakefield [? which one ?] and some English writers had begun the use some years before. In earliest times <i>tangata maori</i>did not mean man of the Maori race but human being as opposed to supernatural being; <i>wai maori</i> was `fresh water'; <i>Whetu maori</i> `inferior stars' Cook spoke of the inhabitants of NZ as <i>Indians,</i> early Europeam writers as <i>natives</i> or New Zealanders.

Quote:   Tangihanga - this word refers specifically to the ceremony which takes place when a person dies. It is closely linked with the idea of `whanaungatanga' (q.v.). People go to the tangi to share their grief with the bereaved family, to reaffirm family ties, to recall the living past.

Quote:  The perfect symbol for all this is the Meremere taniwha. This one-eyed spirit stopped work on a new highway.. and gave National leader Bill English a new slogan. A reference to the Treaty in new legislation became the "taniwha clause" - a phrase coated in political poison... Historian Michael King says the issue "has nothing to do with the literal existence of non-existence of taniwha. Taniwha are a metaphorical way of saying that place is either dangerous or has special spiritual or historical significance. The way Maori signified  that was by talking about taniwha or guardian to make poeople respect it and to explain the fact that sometimes people disppeared or drown or whatever, in those places".

The dictionary describes taonga as 'property', or as 'anything highly prized' (Williams 1971: 381). Thus a taonga tuku iho is a highly prized object that has been handed down from the ancestors. <I>Ibid.</i> 22 In the popular sense a taonga is a highly prized possession to which is attached korero (text or story). An example is a whakapapa (genealogy) staff.

Quote:  The `tapu' or tabboo is a ceremony common to New Zealand, along with all the other South Sea Islands. The power of `tapuing' seems to be vested in the principal chief alone, and may be considered the most important bulwark of his authority. This ceremony [90] renders every object, either animate or inanimate, sacred, or not to be approached, so that no person can enter tapued ground, nor touch a tapued person. Every girl promised in marriage is tapued, and married women also, until chastised by their husbands, when the `tapu' ceases, and they are then free to any one who can catch them, a remarkably good plan for securing the affections of the husband, and relieving the sex from some of those periodical chastisements in which some of the husbands in this country are so apt to indulge. Favourite pigs, canoes, and muskets are sometimes tabooed; burial ground is always tabbooed, and so is also a chief's head.

Quote:  WHITE FRONTED TERN (<I>Sterna striata</I>), Tara of the Maoris, is abundant all around the New Zealand coasts and occurs in Tasmania and Eastern Australia as well. This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai.

Quote:  Occasionally unusual types of hiding games were played, for example All In or Taranaki. In this game there were two teams and a home base. One team, the `outs,' went and hid, while the home team, looked for the `outs.' As soon as an `in' player saw an `out,' he cried, `All in for Tommy Jones' (the `out' player who had been spotted). At that cry all the `in' players raced for home, and all the `out' players emerged from their hiding places and attempted to tag them. If all the `in' players could get home without being tagged, then the person seen (Tommy Jones), was considered captured, and he had to come and sit in the home base, And so the `in' team went on trying to sight players and [53] then get home without being tagged.

The most common use of Taranaki is, of course, for the makeshift gate of wires and battens, which is a nightmare for the novice to open and shut.

These epithets, almost already forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; and the origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation.

Richmond, Esq., at the Sugar Loaves, Taranaki, where it occurs as thin seams which occupy fissures in trachytic rocks. It is described by Dr. Hector (Juror's Rep. N. Z. Ex., 1865, p. 423) as of a yellowish-white colour; amorphous and soft; readily fusible before the blowpipe and in other respects resembling wavellite.

It is probable that this substance will prove to be of some commercial value, as it evidently contains much phosphate of lime, which, for agricultural purposes, is highly esteemed.

A celebration of the joining of Maori and Croatian cultures on the gumfields more than 100 years ago, Tarara Day provides an opportunity for people of Croatian-Maori descent to celebrate their cultures and learn more about their heritage.

‘Tarara’ was the name given to Croatians by Northland Maori to distinguish them from the English.

The principle of Tararua biscuits is that they serve as a replacement for bread on long trips. ... The taste is not a crucial matter, but they must be firm and filling - and all of the same size, otherwise bickering will develop over who's got the biggest.

At one time in the big sheds when any shearer called `tar' there was a tarboy to dab the cut, but now this is usually by the nearest shedhand.

Four years later, on the west coast, he found a perfect cemetery of these bones and heard the bird called for the first time the "moa" - the natives, very singularly, never having heard the name used by their brethren on the other side of the island.

Quote:  The great labour of growing taro maori (the old pre-European variety) caused it to be abandoned when the taro Merekena was introduced. The latter is hardy, prolific, runs wild in fact, and easily cultivated, but it is very inferior in flavour and flouriness to taro maori. I don't think I have seen taro maori for thirty years.

Quote:  A prostitute is not called a tart by Cockneys, because `tart' has always meant a girl. It is a street word, not used indoors, but it is not coarse or unpleasant. It conveys a well made up, attractive girl. One might say `Who's that ginger-haired tart,' or `Harry was talking to a tart', or even `your tart' - though the last shows a poor vocabulary and would be said only by children. The term has been going strong for at least seventy [83] years, and probably derives from something like `jam tart'; given that, why should a reference to colourfulness and sweetness be offensive?

It was illegal to sell tickets in Tatts' in New Zealand but many barbers' shops displayed a notice, `We communicate with Hobart', which was universally understood. . . .It was clear that in the context of a barber's shop window the notice meant `we sell tickets in Tatt's', but legally a man can announce that he writes to Tasmania. Newspapers might report the good fortune of winners but the illegal source of the winnings would not be specified. The money came from `an overseas consultation'.

Quote:  <i>tauhou</i>, a wandering bird (Zosterops halmaturina), blight-bird; twinkie; button-eye; wax-eye; ring-eye. Tauhou means stranger and this name was given by the Maori when the bird appeared, in 1856, in the central part of Newzealand, gradually spreading north and south till the islands were occupied. It is an Australian bird, and was blown across the Tasman sea in the year mentioned.

Quote:  `Pakeha' is a word that seems to be bugging many New Zealanders. Perhaps this is the reason why the Royal Commission on Social Policy in its booklet dealing with the Treaty of Waitangi uses the word `Tauiwi' instead of `Pakeha'. For example a section of the booklet is headed `Partnership between Maori and Tauiwi'. Tauiwi, according to the booklet's glossary, means `later settlers from another country'. A Dictionary of the Maori Language ... gives `strange tribe, foreign race' as the meaning of Tauiwi. As a New Zealander born and bred in this country I was disturbed at the unceremonious use of a word which seems to make me some sort of foreigner in my own land. ... On phoning the commission's office I was informed that despite considerable unease over the use of Tauiwi in the treaty booklet staff were told that it had to be used. I was also informed that the use of Tauiwi instead of Pakeha had been discontinued.

There are also two Taurahere (urban groupings) since 80% of the tribe live outside the traditional Ngâpuhi boundaries (40% in Auckland alone). The TRAION structure is grassroots focussed with the marae and all who whakapapa to these marae being the main drivers for the vision, and for the tribal immortality of Ngâpuhi.

Quote:  [Hdg] "Tauranga" or "Bush Disease". This peculiar wasting disease, which is confined to the tract of land lying in the vicinity of Tauranga, and extending from there to Rotorua and Lichfield, was made the subject of an investigation by Mr. Park three years ago... It appears that both sheep and cattle will do well and put on condition for the first few months after being placed on this diseased country, but as time goes on a gradual wasting sets in, which ends in death if they are not removed to another district.

Quote:  It would seem that to deal thoroughly with the matter much more time and research will have to be given to it, than the examination of a few sheep or lambs can accomplish, though done by as able an expert as Professor Thomas; whose instructions, as to parasitical disease, seem to have been carried out as well as opportunity allowed, and yet disclosed nothing specially distinct in the Tauranga disease.

Quote:  What is often referred to as the "Baby Class" of New Zealand, the 7-foot Tauranga boats, also owe their existence to the efforts of a Wellington yachtsman, Mr. M.H.A. Highet, who was the originator of the class. These tiny yachts, which are built on the chine principle, have a beam of 3.6 feet, and carry a single sail of the gunter type.

Quote:   ... In my introductory essay ... T.W. Kirk was quoted on the singular exception in the case of the beeches, which the Maori seemed to class together as tawhai adding, perhaps, in our own manner, a descriptive modifying word or words, as tawhairaunui for the large-leaved beech. The recent studies of Dr. L. Cockayne (NZ State Forest Service, Bulletin No4, 1926), show that in this, too, the Maori was right ; the rigid specific distinction did not exist: As in Hebe (Veronica) there is much hybridization. ... and as the Veronicas were all Koromiko to the Maori, so the varieties of Nothofagus were all tawhai.

When Maori activist Titewhai Harawira went to the Netherlands in 1990.. she was reportedly advocating <i>Te Ika a Maui</i> and not <i>Aotearoa</i> as an indigenous replacement.

In NZ the term was widely used informally also in relation to electric power lines (=<i>power pole</i>) (I cannot remember ever having seen telegraph lines in the strict sense).

There is no evidence of such games before 1900, but a number of instances between 1900 and 1920 are recorded. The games were known as Fives, Tens, Sevens, and Walls and have been recorded more often since under the names O'Leary or Sevens. Before 1920 there is only one report of the game being played with a rhyme, and this was a rhyme more often used in skipping.

Quote:  The Whakarewa Grant was part of what was called the `tenth', a term coined by the New Zealand Company for land it reserved for Maori people. The principle of the tenths was conveyed in the instructions from the New Zealand Company in 1839 to its principal agent, Colonel William Wakefield, before he set out for New Zealand. In `every purchase of land from the natives ... a proportion of the territory ceded will be reserved by the Company and held in trust by them for the future benefit of the chief families of the tribe ... `You will explain that after English immigration and settlement a tenth of the land will be far more valuable than the whole was before'. ... To Alexander MacKay, commissioner of Native Lands, writing in 1872, the tenths `guarded the natives that common failing of all Aboriginal races, want of foresight, and it secured them from the dangers to which colonisation exposed them'. In short, land was a better asset for the Maoris than cash. In Nelson, the `tenth' comprised a total of 15,000 acres of land, involving a mix of urban and rural land in Nelson, Motueka, and Golden Bay. Most of that land remains in Maori ownership and today is managed by an incorporation. The Whakarewa land - the most valuable area of the tenth - has however been subverted from the control of the ...

It provided that one tenth of the land purchased would be reserved for the Maori owners of the Land... No proper explanation was given to Maori of the 'tenths' reserve scheme, nor were they made aware that the deed of purchase made no provision for the retention by Maori of their pa, cultivations, and burial grounds.

Quote:  It's called "tenure review", an unremarkable term for a remarkable transformation now taking place in our legendary South Island high country. In exchange for giving up the scenic and uneconomic parts of their land for a massive conservation estate, pastoral lease holders get freehold title to the rest of their property. [18] Currently, the main way of achieving it [sc. taking land for the conservation estate]is known as tenure review; a huge land swap inside the pastoral leases that make up 20 percent of the South Island and 10 percent of New Zealand.

I suspect that history will judge tenure review as not such a great idea for farmning or the public... What should have happened is a careful review of the pastoral lease system to maintain this unique form of land tenure, with adjustments to assist farmers to diversify and to protect uneconomic land.

All New Zealanders from the ages of 14 to 30 years were liable for part-time military training. Boys from 14 to 18 years served in the senior cadets, and young men from 18 to 25 years served as Territorial soldiers with the regionally affiliated regiments and battalions - hence the name `Territorial'. Service in the reserve was a requirement from the age of 25 to 30, but legislation allowed for this service to be extended up to the age of 55 years in the case of a national emergency. The same legislation allowed the Territorial Force to be mobilised by proclamation for service in New Zealand, and Section 26 (1) of the 1909 Defence Act made provision for members of the Territorial Force to volunteer for special service outside New Zealand.

Under the partnership agreement Stead managed the business side while the training was put in the hands of E. Cutts. The horses were raced in the name of one or other of the partners. This arrangement, which proved immensely successful, lasted into the 1890s and was terminated when Stead bought out Redwood's share of the stud. During his lifetime Henry Redwood was known as `the Father of the New Zealand Turf.'

Quote:  <i>they're off, Mr Cutts!</i> the race has begun; Partridge identifies as a variant of `they're off', said the monkey', usually indicating start of a horse race, hence as something that has come loose; often with addition: `when he looked into the lawnmower and carelessly lost his testicles.' This addition may explain Mr Cutts. NZA.

National's "third rail" is not a new policy alternative but a warning to its own politicians. The third rail on a railway track is the live one, the dangerous one. Touch its political equivalent and you risk a nasty electoral shock from the voting public... The politics of the third rail are simple: avoid, downplay or defuse issues for which the majority of the public has no stomach, even if the party and its MPs think they are desirable.

Quote:  Australian aborigine words which were new to this side. In 1851 a number of Australian `squatters' came over and took up runholding in Canterbury, but, generally speaking, their advent was some years later in Otago. ... They brought over a number of Australian aborigine words that were new to this side, and which were used a certain amount, usually in a joking manner as far as I know. I have heard some of them fairly frequently used by the `old hands,' sometimes oracularly and sometimes as a semi-humorous quotation. When I was a boy I heard sheep called `jumbucks,' an Australian aborigine term for them, but with the decease of ex-Australian stockmen the word has gone out of use now. Another term brought over from Australia was `maimai,' for a rough shelter from the weather. It was said to be a name for a blackfellow's camp, which I have always seen spelt `miamia,' and which is called `gunyah' or `wurley,' etc., by some tribes. We now apply the name to shooting shelters.

Quote:  The coach used at the time was a type

known as a "Thorough Brace," which meant

that instead of steel springs the coach

was suspended on several thicknesses of

buffalo leather, which ran from the front

under the body to the back of the coach.

These coaches were in common use

throughout Australia and New Zealand in

the early days of mail coaches. Leather

suspension was used because steel springs

would not stand up to the rough roads.

To other than fishermen and those intimately connected with the fishing industry it is just a Flounder. Some say it is Tinplate because when cooked it fills a plate.

Quote:  DELUGED [heading] I am beginning to think that I must be the only ignoramus in Dunedin who has never heard of a thunderplump. Everyone else has known the word since childhood and, as a Buccleugh Street reader neatly put it, I was fairly deluged with thunderplumps yesterday. Other readers wanted to explain that `plumps' were to be found in many dictionaries, but I was aware of that anyway. Most of the people who knew of thunderplump claimed a Scottish origin for it, but it still took me quite a time to locate it in my range of dictionaries. Finally I ran it to earth in a seven-volume Century, published back in 1891, which gave it as `A short violent downpour of rain in connection with a thunder-storm (Rare),' and produced a 19th century quotation. Perhaps we didn't hear it much in Invercargill in my younger days because thunderplumps are pretty uncommon there; but a colleague who came from Winton certainly knew of it; and it was even noised abroad by the Canterbury English. ...

The lack of a documented history, the unusual dwarf suckering habit, and the observation that it had never been  recorded to flower suggested to us that Cordyline 'Thomas Kirk' could be the forgotten ti tawhiti... <i>Ibid.</i> 49 The name ti tawhiti is translated as "the ti from a distant place" or alternatively "the ti from Tahiti".

Quote:  One common prank was Knick Knock. In this game, children knocked on someone's door, then ran away, but it could be played more elaborately: In Tick Tack we stuck a pin into the middle sash of a window; a button was suspended from this on a piece of cotton. Then a long length of cotton was attached to the smaller piece and led away to the gate. The cotton was pulled every now and then and the button tapped against the window. It was nighttime, and folks would pull up the blind and peer out. Some more adventurous spirits would come out and investigate and would maybe get entangled with the cotton. Then the culprit would run away to some other house. (1900; Moeraki)

Barrie's <i>Peter Pan</i> where Hook was always warned of the approach of the crocodile because of the ticks of the alarm clock it had swallowed. If a master approaches, the boys warn the rest with `tick tick!'. Also used in the expression `to go tick' - that is, to go on watch for masters and prefects while the rest get into mischief.

Quote:  They [curing-sticks] usually carry from eight to ten plants, and are hung in the shed by resting the ends of the sticks on tier-poles. These are strong squared timber, 2in by 4in., lying horizontally, and held in position by bolting them to uprights .. If the distance between curing-sticks on the tier-poles is reckoned at 8 in., it is now possible to work out the accommodation required for curing the crop.

Quote:  I was at a Sunday night concert given by the Derwent Infantry Band recently, and one of the items was Mozart's "Gloria," rendered in what I think fine style, and as the last note died away there was but one solitary attempt at applause, and that was drowned by the shouts of the "dear" children (who are always prominent at our open-air concerts nowadays), playing "Tiggy touchwood," or some other Sabbath pastime, which must be in great favour with the police, for they never seem to interfere, although to the person who goes to hear the music such amusements are rather annoying.

Quote:  . This term refers to the customs, rules, habits and accepted ways of behaving in each tribal area, and as such may differ from marae to marae. Even within marae. one cannot know all the `tikianga' of that tribe, since aspects of life may only be known by specialists. To find out the tikianga of each marae, one should ask connected tangata whenua or knowledgeable people of the right way to enter and speak and act on that marae. To break `nga tikanga' is to invite (polite) scorn and this means a lowering of `mana'. Tikanga - see `kawa'.

These were <I>Galaxias attenuatus </I>and <I>Retropinna retropinna</I>. At present Canterbury residents refer to<I> R. retropinna</I> as `silvery,' on account of the silver line running along the side of the half-grown fish. Maoris refer to this `silvery' as `tikihemi,' and to the adult as `paraki.'

Certain races of fish have a broad silvery band running along the side; hence the term `silvery.' It is to be regretted that in Canterbury the term smelt is still used to apply to the minnow, <i>Galaxias attenuatus. </i>

A hardy tree, growing from sea level to timber line and often forming pure forests, especially in Nelson and Southland. ...Some stems become malformed through infestations of mistletoe, <i>Elytranthe colensoi</i>, and it is the only known host for our three species of <i>Cyttaria</i>, strawberry fungi which cause large galls.

The timber-jacks consist of a toothed spear, two pinions, a cogged wheel, all of wrought iron, and properly arranged in a strong piece of wood.

The logs are forced along this road by timber-jacks, which the bushmen use with remarkable skill, and are impelled with a rapidity which is simply astonishing to persons unused to the process.

Quote:  The bushmen that did this work were a tough capable lot - a race apart - whom no difficulty could deter, and who performed amazing feats with a few quite primitive tools. These were axes, maul, and wedges, crosscut saws, mattocks for earth work, pinching bars or crowbars, and the versatile New Zealand-made timber jack. These jacks weighed about 80 pounds and by geared cogs multiplied the man power applied to the revolving handles so that the `spear' with its two chisel points, when applied to a log, could exert a lifting pressure of 5 tons.

We would find one, put a fistful of gravel in it and drive the sheep. They were called 'tin dogs'".

[The terms `Tin Hat' and `Brass Hat' were current years before the war began, especially `Tin Hat.' Probably the expression had its origin in the metallic headgear worn by some of the military units in pre-war days. There is no evidence (at least no etymological evidence) that `tin-hat' is a corruption of `tin-head,' as one cynic has suggested.]

Quote:  Next to the header harvester, the `tin' mill did the mill [sc. threshing] men most disservice. This smaller style of mill came in with the tractor by which it was drawn and driven. The `tin' mill only needed seven or eight men to operate it, and its output was no more than half that of the `big' mill. But within a short time these small mills became so popular that many farmers bought their own and could thresh their grain exactly when it suited them and their crops. The `tin' mill and the `Sunshine' header thus put an effective end to the era of the mill men [in South Canterbury].

The common Sand-flounder is known from one end of New Zealand to the other, sometimes by other names in different localities. In Auckland it is known as the Dab.../ Some refer to it as Tinplate or Three Corner; the latter name is derived from its fancied trangular shape but why Tinplate I am at a loss to know. To other than fishermen and those intimately connected with the fishing industry it is just a Flounder. Some say it is Tinplate because when cooked it fills a plate.

Quote:  [In the Lyttelton Gaol]"Tip it' is something after the style of eggs in the bush. You have one button and some two or three fellows play another two or three. One side guesses which hand of the others contains the button. If they don't guess right it scores one against them. If they do, they take the button and the others guess.

Another widely known trick was Jingle the Penny: `We tied a string to a penny with a hole in it, then hid behind a hedge or on top of a verandah. As a person stooped to pick it up, we would whisk it away' (1895; Ngakawau).

Quote:  The appearance of Ti palms on the Canterbury plains is very remarkable. They rise amidst the short rich grass with their thick stalks and graceful crest; often when one looks up suddenly from the ground, startling with their likeness to men. One of our wags remarked of these plants, that they looked `like men as trees walking'. A less observant youth having lost his way a few nights ago, in the neighbourhood of the capital, was cheered in the loneliness of the prairie, by the appearance of a man approaching. He took off his hat, (not having yet forgotten the courteous address of the old country,) and accosted the stranger, `I beg your pardon, sir, but can you tell me which is the way to Christchurch.' It was a Ti palm.

Quote:  Another bird, the tierawaki (Jeterus rufisater, Less.), is very common. It is as large as a blackbird, of a jet-black plumage, with red-brown coverlets of the wings and tail. It has two small orange-coloured appendages at the base of the beak. This bird is seen on the lower branches of trees, is very lively, and has a loud penetrating note. It always screams when anything attracts its attention - huei, huei, tierawak, tierawak. It feeds principally on fleshy berries, but also on coleopterous insects.

Quote:  <i>raddled:</i> This word means `robbed' in the sense of being deprived of one's proper payment. It is an extension of `raddling', carried out by unscrupulous farmers before the Shearers' Union looked after shearers' interests. Any sheep considered unsatisfactorily shorn was marked with red or blue raddle and such a sheep would not be counted in the shearer's tally. The raddle stick was also called a `Toby'. This must not be confused with [27] marking a sheep for other purposes, such as identification of certain sheep for easy selection later.

Quote:  What is the origin of the "toby". the tap that turns off water at the street frontage of a house?... I am prepared to wager that it is derived from "toby", which was the gypsy-tinker slang term for "street. There is an early link between tinkers and plumbers, both being experts with the soldering-iron, and I think the plumbers took over "toby" from the tinkers. Consequently, when they turned water off "at the toby" they were turning it off at the street.

Quote:  <i>Toe-ragger, n.</i> In the bush a term of abuse; though curiously in one or two parts of New South Wales the word `toey,' which is derived from it, is a term of praise, a `swell.' The word has been explained as of convict origin, that the rags were used to soothe the galling of fetters; but the explanation is not satisfactory, for the part galled by the irons would not be the toe, but the ankle. A writer in `Truth' has cleared up the word (see quotation). It is of Maori origin. Away from Maoriland "toe-rigger' had no meaning, and a false meaning and origin were given by the change of vowel.

Though the name toetoe is by the Pakeha confined to Arundo, by the Maori it is applied to various species of rush and grass with a qualifying suffix: Arundo is toetoe-kakaho, the latter word referring to the valued culms. Some people object to the reed tukutuku-work as being flimsy and perishable: in reality it is as durable as galvanized-iron and far more handome and artistic: the interior of a good Maori house is a thing of beauty.

Quote:  Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II[roman] brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.

Quote:  Wonder how bookmakers came to be known as `Tommies"? `Tommy [sic] is short for Tommy Rook, and probably it was owing to `rook' sounding something like "book' that caused some wag to term him as such. A rook would apply to some bookmakers, but where does the `Tommy' come in? The bookmakers were never named Tommies after soldiers, who are so dubbed, for when the latter lie on the field they've generally been shot at, whereas the bookie when he lays on the field, he's not been shot at, and, moreover, he never lays himself open to be shot at, either by marksmen or punters. Tommy is certainly a misnomer, and it should have been applied to a backer, who is ever the target for the unerring aim of the Bar Von.

She said many old miners or children of miners had rung her to identify the object.

Pit-candle holders were used with carbide lamps in mines. The pointed part was put into the pit prop with the hook hanging down. The candle was put through the hoop.

Quote:  The now obsolete term <i>tonguer</i> was also in use in the early 1830's, and very likely before it although I have discovered no written records of it prior to 1836. A tonguer was a native or white living in New Zealand who assisted a whaling crew to cut up whales and who also acted in the capacity of an interpreter. These men earned their name not from the act of interpreting, but from the fact that they were given the whale's carcase and tongue to dispose of as they wished.

I left them [sc Maoris] Came [sic] on board and despatched the boat the other side for a linguist our tounger. (The Ships all employ Tonguers [sic] and it is a general custom I have acceded on the same terms as others) On his arrival we opened the Subject but they [sc Maoris] were ashamed and finally settled that they would build the house. ...

I must not omit here Some mention of what are called tonguers. they [sic] are here 2 and 3 white people who have a boat and some natives on a ship arriving they repair on board to solicit the Job for the ship The terms are that they occasionally furnish a crew to help tow whales they furnish a boats crew to help cut the whale in and do any talking for the captain whose ignorance of the language requires their aid in any matters with the natives. When the whale is cut in they are entitled to the carcass and the tongue which in plentiful Whaling is always left on the carcass and they contrive to get for [sic] 6 to 8 barrels of oil from each carcass but they are in general Blackguards and no dependence can be put in them - Runaways from Ships Mostly. [McNab's ed. fn] The Americans had ... to rely to a great extent upon Maori labour and to be indebted to the services of interpreters. These men were locally [?Cloudy Bay] called `tonguers'. ... In `The Piraki Log' [1911] the word `tonguer' is suggested as a corruption of the Maori `tonga'. This is quite wrong. The tonguer was a man who interpreted and assisted in cutting up and who was paid with the tongue of the whale.[choose between this and following citation???]

Quote:  The tongue was of a white or ash colour, blackish towards the root. This organ gave several barrels of oil, and is a monopoly of the `tonguer,' or `cutter-in.' The latter operation is performed in Te-awa-iti near the shores, where by means of a windlass the whale is raised to the surface of the water under a scaffold called the `shears.' <i>Ibid.</I> 1/109 To this quantity must be added the tonguer's oil, so called from the man who `cuts-in the whale,' for which he is allowed the oil of the tongue, of the heart, and of the intestines, for his own benefit.

Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occurred in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood. <i>Ibid.</i> 302 All the men engaged at the sawmills [of West Oxford] had heard of `tooth-leaved beech,' but only one or two of them had seen it growing, and no one had seen it converted.

Quote:  The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.

I was indignant to find that they had been weighed with great bunches of tops, which added somewhat to their weight, particularly as they had gone to seed.   When I asked that the carrots should be weighed without this top-hamper, I was told that they had been bought from the Internal Marketing Department in that condition so they were obliged to sell them with the tops on to avoid loss to themselves.

Quote:  Ever since the beginning, to `take' meant journeying to the islands and living there for the season and using hands or any device to catch the birds. ... to `take' also includes an `attempt to take'. During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path. If one pursues a bird and grabs it over the other edge of the path one can be prosecuted, even although the bird came from the pursuer's manu. <i>Ibid.</I> 68 The `torching' season became known as such because the birders used flaming torches thick enough to be held aloft comfortably grasped in the hand. They were about three feet long and well soaked in muttonbird fat, before being set alight and were made from dry tree branches. Piles of these `torches' were prepared and set aside awaiting [69] the start of the `torching' and each family had their torch bearers. In most cases this duty was carried out by the children. Gradually this primitive method of `lighting the way' gave place to the European kerosene lantern and when supplies of kerosene were exhausted a lighted candle was sometimes used inside the glass globe of the lantern.

Quote:  (fn) This song has a great deal of meaning : the being bereft of pipe refers to the very heavy duty which had been put on tobacco, to make the native, who was the chief consumer, pay as much as possible; but this over-grasping defeated itself. The native, unable to purchase tobacco to the extent he formerly did, began to grow it himself, and from instructions he has contrived to pick up, he now manufactures it; this he calls <I>torore</I>; some of it is so well made that there are great smokers who will give equal weight of our best tobacco for it.

He refused to `point the finger' at where Mr Maddox got the dope. `... this has spoilt a good day. I have been raging all day. I punched him over because he tried to punch me over, and put me in my place. He reckoned he was a Liverpudlian seaman who had been here for 20 years, a big toughie,' Gilbert had told him.

Quote:  The red pines are the <i>Totara, Towa, Mahi</i>, and <i>Rata</i>, all of which are close-grained, and moderately hard. They are used principally for interior work, in house-building, and for furniture-making. They are all of a red colour, and when oiled and polished are very ornamental. ... All these red firs make good spars for ships, and are frequently used by vessels visiting the settlements. The Towa spars are considered the best for this purpose. The fore-yard of the <i>Tory</i>, a 400 ton ship, was made from a green <i>towa</i> spar obtained in Queen Charlotte's Sound, which stood many severe tests without sustaining any injury. ... The only fault of this wood is its weight, but in that respect it is less objectionable than the teak which is used for the masts of all Indian-built vessels. [43] ... The <i>Towa</i> and the <i>Kraka</i> berries also yield an useful oil, but not in such quantity as that first mentioned.

This was very commendable and necessary in some instances, but where a township, as sometimes happened, did not `go off' at the sale, or if it did go off, was never subsequently embellished with a building of any kind, the effect had something of the ludicrous about it - for while settlement went on around the `township,' and the land was cleared and occupied, the `town' itself remained a solid block of standing bush, and the absentee owners of its acre or quarter-acre sections were only reminded of their possessions by the persistent recurrence of the notices to pay rates

Quote:  In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track</i>, a <i>trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander... <i>Track</i> is undoubtedly the established word in New Zealand. It is the only one occurring on maps or applied to named routes, such as <i>Hongi's track</i>, the <i>Milford track</i>, the <i>Pahiatua Bush Track Road</i>. ..[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail</i> occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of <i>trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arthur’s Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail </i>in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail </i>is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i>

Quote:  In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i>. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper, </i>

I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime<i> deer track </i>still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i>

Quote:  In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track, trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander. ... I well remember the shock of astonishment when in 1937 I first saw <i>trail </i>used in New Zealand. The word was on a rough signpost pointing out the beginning of White's Track at Piha. I am afraid I thought somewhat scornfully, `Hm, some townie who has never been out of the city or set foot off a pavement has got all his ideas of New Zealand outdoor life from reading books about North America.'...[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail </i>occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of<i> trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arhtur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there

is the <i>B.B. Trail</i> in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail</i> is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </I>

Quote:  In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between<i> track </i>and <i>trail.</i> I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper</i>, I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime <i>deer track</i> still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i>

Quote:  Words that concern walking and moving about might be expected to be of interest to a tramper. First there is the word <i>tramp</i> itself. Though the Club in 1919 was the first in New Zealand and probably the first in the world to take the name of <i>tramping club</i>, and by its usage and activities has played a considerable part in establishing the term, the meaning we give to <i>tramp</i> was not of New Zealand origin, for it was used colloquially in England as early as 1908 for `to go on foot, to go on a walking expedition'. The nature of the country into which the expeditions are made may often be very different from that [29] where the term originated, but the essential idea is the same. ...

Did they go tramping as such or were they out for food, or greenstone, or other Maori? And what about the gold-digger and the musterer? Surely their trades came first and if they enjoyed the walk it was likely that it was because they'd found some good pasture or a `bit of the colour'.

In the daytime they struggled through thickets of high fern, manuka and toitoi, and waded through icy flax swamps which caused them to suffer from swollen legs, rheumatism and colds. 'We surveyors as Pioneers,' wrote Samuel Stephens,'have a great deal of this tramping, and most tiring work it is.'

Quote:  `Pakeha' is a word that seems to be bugging many New Zealanders. Perhaps this is the reason why the Royal Commission on Social Policy in its booklet dealing with the Treaty of Waitangi uses the word `Tauiwi' instead of `Pakeha'. For example a section of the booklet is headed `Partnership between Maori and Tauiwi'. Tauiwi, according to the booklet's glossary, means `later settlers from another country'. A Dictionary of the Maori Language ... gives `strange tribe, foreign race' as the meaning of Tauiwi.

As a New Zealander born and bred in this country I was disturbed at the unceremonious use of a word which seems to make me some sort of foreigner in my own land. ... On phoning the commission's office I was informed that despite considerable unease over the use of Tauiwi in the treaty booklet staff were told that it had to be used. I was also informed that the use of Tauiwi instead of Pakeha had been discontinued

Quote:  Though by no means faultless, the measure [1846 Constitution Act] seems calculated to be a fair opening to the true history of our great Southern Colony, after the preliminary chapters of tragi-comic blundering. It sweeps away the whole system of official machinery and self-impeding sophistry established by Lord Stanley - all the `Treaty of Waitangi' nonsense, and all the past Downing-Street plans for hindering the settlement of the islands.' Henceforward, echoed the Colonial Gazette, `the humbug treaty of Waitangi' would be `very properly laid on the shelf'.

A reference to the widely-held belief in a clause of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between Governor Hobson and some of the Maori chiefs, which ostensibly guarantees to Maoris the right to hunt and fish for as long as they wish in the country of which they gave sovereignty to Queen Victoria, the queen Moses blesses. Recent historical research shows that the supposed clause is not present in the Maori text that was signed, though it occurs in some of the variant English versions. ... In any case Maoris have not been exempt from laws restricting fishing and hunting.

call a tree avalanche. Because Fiordland

was so thoroughly gouged by glaciers,

there is virtually no topsoil on the


steeper valley sides. Even the fully-

grown forest has only the precarious hold

of a woven skin of roots that stretch

over rock. This net has a weak grip and

if one section tears free it can peel the

forest from the cliff-faces in great

strips. The fall of just one tree can

trigger a tree avalanche.

Quote:   ... we can be sure that the beauty-loving soul of the ancient Maori delighted whole-heartedly in these lovely inhabitants of the New Zealand bush. However, his interest in the different tree ferns was certainly not purely aesthetic. Take, for instance, the mamaku, or `black tree fern'

(<i>Cyathea medullaris</i>). This is one of the largest and most handsome of all our tree ferns. It can be distinguished by the black stalks of the fronds and the leaf scars that form a definite pattern all round the slender black stem.

[WWII] <i>Ibid.</I> 141 New Zealanders always used to know the tamarillo by the rather uninspired name of `tree tomato', but after the fruit became a big export business in the 1960s, the growers decided to change the name to the far more appealing `tamarillo', in 1967.

Quote:  Although it sounds Spanish, the name ‘tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name ‘tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word ‘tama' added ‘tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced ‘t' with an ‘r'. Thus, ‘tamarillo' was born.

The Trekka became known as  "the poor man's Land Rover", and many an unfortunate motorist made the mistake of treating their Trekka as if it were a Land Rover, and came to grief when attempting to tackle rough terrain... Even so, the maker found it necessary to suggest to new Trekka owners that "if the engine fails to start ... a push start may be sufficient."

It's a brilliant story, New Zealand's only locally designed and mass-produced motor vehicle, the Trekka, was the brainchild of Noel Turner, a millionaire who supported Labour. The first Trekka rolled off his assembly line in Otahuhu ion 1966. It came in two colours... It had a four cylinder engine, and took 11 gallons in the tank... Turner's formula was a Skoda mechanical kit, bought at basement prices from Czechoslovakia, bolted to a simple boxy body.

The Trekka was the ultimate product of a mnyriad of import restrictions in the 1960s, designed to foster motor vehicle assembly in New Zealand. It was loved by those who admired it's [sic] cheap no-nonsense style as a Land Rover lookalike...  "The Trekka is a way of repsenting the idea of New Zealand as an industrialised state, an example of what New Zealand in those days could become"...

Quote:  TREVALLY (ARAARA) <I>Usacaranx lutescens</I> (Richardson) For some unknown reason small Warehou sold on the Dunedin Fish Market and in the shops of Dunedin were called Trevally and the same fish with the same markings when grown to eighteen or twenty-four inches in length were known as Warehou. Just how and when these small Warehou received the name Trevally no one seems to know. .../ [T]he old time Maori was recognised as a student of Nature and much more observant than the Pakeha, who blindly follows other and called fish by all sorts of names without ever stopping to think - as for instance when they call Seaperch the John Dory. Each fish is totally different. The misuse of common names of fish in New Zealand is most glaring but the mistake of calling the young Warehou by the name of Trevally is not made in the North Island, as both species are caught there; only odd Trevally are caught south of Cook Strait.

Quote:  As the quartz mines began to decline in output and could no longer pay a large wage sheet, it became the custom to let them on tribute, by which parties of men were given the right to mine and raise quartz from the resultant crushing, of which a proportionate share of the gold went to the company. This system might also apply to old workings of mines in actual work, but in most of these cases the tributors followed a thin but valuable lead, which might not be much thicker than a finger, but so rich as to be worth tunnelling or working as a tribute, in which the golden lead was pursued on an upward slope. It used to be rather shrewdly suspected that tributors were not `working on the blind' but had as former employees of the company marked a lead and covered the same by a piece of mine timber or rubble till a later date give them the chance to profit by their knowledge. Many of the tributors did exceedingly well; they had nothing except their labour to lose, and the company got some profit on a good lead, and so `where's the harm?'

Their offer to allow the mine to be worked under tribute (which it was for several years) was bitterly opposed by the unions which claimed that the co-operative system meant the speeding of production at the expense of conditions, and that the people working in co-operative systems were little concerned about the conditions that had been built up through industrial organisation and effort over a long time.

Quote:  The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

While its name was no more meaningful than the American borrowing of 'popsicle' that has replaced it, it was ours .. Apparently there was no TT1."

Quote:  It was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.

The little restless piwakawaka [a2,a4-acute], a kind of thrush, who is incessantly hopping from twig to twig, put forth its single note. <I>Ibid.</I> 1/296

The <I>tui</I>, or mocking-bird, is best known to the stranger in the country. The natives vend these birds, in wicker cages, to their transient visitors : it is called tui, from the resemblance of its note to that sound.

Quote:  <i>tui</i>, a bird (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), the most characteristic of the smaller Maori birds, kept by the Maori as a pet and by them taught to speak, it being an excellent mimic, and so by the settlers called the mocking-bird, shortened to mockie, and called parson-bird because of the two white curled tufts of feathers at its throat. Then, [check parson-bird inclusion - not in Journ Polyn Soc ref???] because some folk thought mockie was short for makomako, a name of the bell-bird (korimako) in some parts, some thought it was the korimako which was the mimic, and hence both birds have been called the mocking-birds.

Quote:  We have a new word in the language. On Wednesday I heard some Lower Hutt schoolboys discussing the birthday of one of their number. When he was asked what sort of presents he'd got, the birthday boy recited a list, and about half-way through he said, "and I got some new tukus"... I look forward to the next edition of the Oxford New Zealand Dictionary, for the inevitable entry:tuku n. pl (Colloq.) 1. underpants, worn by males, usu. decorative. [abbrev. of Tukuroirangi, Maori]. 2. v. intr. (sl). 1. offer to sell an interview on a matter of importance when a Member of Parliament.

Notes: (from kiwianatown.co.nz) Tukutuku are intricately woven panels often found lining the walls of the Wharenui (meeting house).  These panels express ideas from Maori mythology, philosophy and history. The patterns displayed here are : Tumatakahuki (pattern either side) double/triple binding which ensures strength. Poutama (steps) has religious and educational connotations relating to levels of attainment. Roimata Toroa (albatross tears) denoting misadventure particularly to crops. Purapura Whetu (myriad of stars) relates to population and the peopling of a region.

It had two curved handles and often a board to sweep the hay off when the handles were released by the driver who walked [behind. When] the handles were released the sweep turned over completely and just carried on for the next load.

Tuna Kuwharuwharu are one of New Zealand's most ancient inhabitatns but have decreased in number so rapidly that they are now nearing endangered status.

The name as then changed to conform with that used in America. Since then Southern Bluefin tuna, Yellowfin tuna and Striped, or Skipjack, tuna have been developed into important export fishes. In New Zealand the Albacore has become an important commercial fish.

This protection was called puru and the sandals were then known as tupuru." Patiti was also regarded as "a fine thing to put in the paraerae to keep the feet warm and if one was wading it was warmer with patiti around the feet than without it."

And you can no more separate the land from the wine than you can call a Greek a Turk, or vice versa, which is why Europe is riddled with those convoluted wine regulations that read like a dialogue for a frustrated Homer Simpson - DO, DOG, AoC, VDQS, QmP, QbA! What all these mean is turangawaewae, the place that wine calls home, and there is only one.

The bark is thin, and of a light colour; the leaves are silvery green, and the flowers pale yellow... The bark exudes a thick gum, and the juice of the leaves, which is somewhat similar, was formerly used by the Maoris as a perfume, but I fear it is too resinous for European tastes.

A strip of ground about 30 yards long by four or five wide was scooped free of top soil, which was dumped on the garden nearby. It was then ploughed about ten inches deep, or according to the number of bricks required, and very well watered, which was usually done with a shovel from a tank on a sledge for even distribution, and left to soak all night. A good layer of chopped-up tussocks was then evenly spread over the top. After more watering a six-horse team was driven up and down the strip until the pug was well mixed.

(<i>Poa caespitosa </i>) but sometimes <i>brown </i>. and sometimes <i>yellow </i> or silver. On the other hand, some men call the blue one <i>silver </i> (rare). <i>White t.</i> includes at least two varieties, a poa and a fescue (Festuca [novae-zealandiae]). The poa is a sign of good country and the fescue is not; but five shepherds out of six can't tell them part. The dreariness of the brown tussock plains seems to have been the first thing that struck every newcomer to Canterbury.

The name `tussock' is applied to those tufted grasses which hold water in the decaying leaves at the base. Tall tussock is dominant in subalpine regions and low tussock in montane and lowland country, though in Southland the red tussock reaches sea level and dominates much of the landscape.

Quote:  <i>Tutu</i>, or <i>Toot, n</i>. Maori name for a shrub or small tree, <i>Coriaria ruscifolia,</i> Linn., or <i>C. sarmentosa,</i> Forst., of New Zealand, widely distributed. It bears greenish flowers, and shiny pulpy black berries. From these the Maoris make a wine resembling light claret, taking care to strain out and not to crush the seeds, which are poisonous, with an action similar to that of strychnine. It goes also by the name of <i>Wineberry-bush</i>, and the Maori name is Anglicised into <i>Toot.</i> In Maori, the final <i>u</i> is swallowed rather than pronounced. In English names derived from the Maori, a vowel after a mute letter is not sounded. It is called in the North Island <i>Tupakihi.</i> In Maori, the verb <i>tutu</i> means to be hit, wounded, or vehemently wild, and the name of the plant thus seems to be connected with the effects produced by its poison. To `eat your toot': used as a slang phrase; to become acclimatised, to settle down into colonial ways.

Quote:  The toot-plant, tutu or tupakihi of the Maoris ... is a small bush, one of the most common and widely distributed shrubs of the islands. It produces a sort of `hoven' or narcotic effect on sheep and cattle, when too greedily eaten. It bears a fruit, which is produced in clusters, not unlike a bunch of currants, with the seed external, of a purple colour. The poisonous portion of the plant to man are the seeds and seed-stalks, while their dark purple pulp is utterly innocuous and edible. The natives express from the berries an agreeable violet juice (carefully avoiding the seed), called native wine.

The last word reminds me of a man near by who was even judged to be somewhat vain of his Maori accent and pronunciation. With one word indeed he was very particular, he could not bring himself to use that manifest corruption `toot'. With him it was ever `tutu'. He had to make rather a boggle or dodge of it when he used the colonial made verb formed on his favourite Maori noun.

Quote:  The old method of tightening the chain securing the logs to trucks is called `twitching', or `taking a twitch'. First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is pased through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When the chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch'. `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `hitch'.

Quote:  The crown was called a<i> bull</i>, a <i>cartwheel</i>, a <i>caser, five bob</i>, and most familiar of all a <i>dollar</i>, the latter dating from the time when the rate of exchange was four US dollars to the pound. The only instance recorded of Cockney rhyming slang term for a coin is <i>Oxford scholar,</i> the derivation from dollar being obvious.

The half crown was called a <i>half-dollar</i>, a <i>half-bull, half-caser</i>, <i>two-and-a-kick,</i> and <i>two-and-a-buck</i>. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only <i>two bob</i> being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

Quote:  <i>Ages of sheep. </I>Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a <I >lamb </I> until weaned. After weaning a lamb is called a <I> hogget </I> until shorn. A male lamb is a <I> ram lamb </I> until castrated, then a <I> wether </I>. A female lamb is a <I> ewe lamb </I>. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a <I> shorn hogget </I> until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a <I> two-tooth </I>. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a <I> four-tooth, then a <I> six-tooth </I> and then an <I> eight-tooth </I> or <I> full-mouthed </I> sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

Quote:  [Mount Ruapehu] Are you a `type' or an `odd-bod'? It was several days before I fathomed this out. The cry would go up, `Ruapehu types arriving, get cracking'. The best club cups would be sorted out, an official or prominent member would greet the new-comers, show them proudly over the house and dispense tea and hospitality with a cordial air. Then I'd hear, `Odd-bods coming up the track'. A member would supervise his arrival, see that no one entered the club room with nailed boots on, and offer a cup of tea, but there was not that ostentatious display of club china, `eats' and cordiality. I found that a `type' is a member of a recognised club and therefore someone to be treated with respect. An `odd-bod' is also a tramper or mountaineer, but of no specified breed, though entitiled to shelter. The same law holds for bush and mountain; hospitality must be dispensed for folk of the right ilk, so that the billy is always on the boil. But tourists! Well, I'd just hate to be a tourist! They were treated with loftiest contempt. I suppose I come under the heading `odd-bod', vouched for by a `type' ...
