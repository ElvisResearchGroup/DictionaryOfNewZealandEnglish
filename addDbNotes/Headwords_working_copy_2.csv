14401	mongrel	1	1	1	1952 Feb 16 R.Gilberd notes on Mongrel Reading `Talking of Words' (Cecil Hull) p21`We might objectively and scientifically describe him, if he were ours, as a dog of mixed breeds - ... we would not be pleased if an acquaintance calls that dog a mongrel.'  In town where dogs are kept largely for appearance and display `mongrel' I think has only one meaning - that a dog is of mixed breeding (with a note of disapproval or contempt). In the country mongrel has two independent meanings.  (i) A dog of mixed blood. Objective - no emotional content. Indeed `pedigreed' is acquiring something of the mongrel taint, in that if a good dog has a pedigree it is mentioned with a faint note of surprise.  (ii) A `no-good' whether man or animal.  `He turned out mongrel' (Rod Macaulay speaking of a pedigreed mastiff that took to sheep worrying.)  `When Bill brought him home I knew he'd turn out a mongrel. Sort of a cow-y look about his head.' (Walter Hull discussing a pedigreed `Totara Park' Friesian bull which proved sterile.)  Talking of dogs:  An `eye-dog' is a specialised type of header which works very quietly, never taking its eyes off the sheep it is trying to pen. Sheep men generally seem to think the dog hypnotises the sheep into being penned quietly. I believe that the fixity of its gaze and its complete concentration enable it to detect and counter any rebelliousness on the part of the sheep before the sheep have quite made up their minds.

4560	copper Maori	1	1	1	Copper Maori seems to have been used by Europeans in the North Island (esp. Northland) for the more usual hangi, umu. with <I>copper</I>. The Maori suffix (variously spelt in early texts) is curious. (1) It is used both with its flexionless Maori pl and its anglicised pl in -s. (2) If it is an aj, the placement after the noun follows Maori grammatical usage: a fuller anglicisation would be <I>Maori copper</I>, occas. used. (3) Williams (p?) states that <I>Maori aj and n `native, belonging to New Zealand' is a comparatively recent use not recorded before 1850, and probably first used by Maoris themselves. Is this an early Maori use of the modern sense of Maori? Or an early Pakeha use? (4) Or is it a use of the sense `normal, usual, ordinary' <I>- kopa Maori</I> being the usual earth-oven, perhaps distinct from the iron tripot etc., (then called in English `copper'), the <I>*kopa Pakeha; </I>

He was allowed to get away with one of these, but on doing a second, was eased off the ship. Hence it came to mean a bad discharge in general.
