Quote:  The Story of the saddleback would not be complete without some reference to the mystery which for many years surrounded the so-called `Jack-bird'. This bird, once thought to be a

different from the saddleback, is of the same size, but of a uniform coffee-brown colour. One writer has likened the colours of the saddleback to ink and cocoa respectively, and that of the `Jack-bird' to the colour of ink stirred into cocoa! It has now been established that the `Jack-bird' is really a juvenile saddleback in its first year plumage, and that later the full plumage and larger cheek-wattles are developed. This applies to the South Island saddleback only; since the first edition of this album was published it has been discovered that the North Island saddleback is a 

distinct sub-species and has no `Jack-bird' plumage in its juvenile stage, but has the saddle from the time of leaving the nest.

Quote:  Stagknife (K-31), a universal game of nineteenth-century childhood, was important because it was played with the most treasured play object of all boys, the pocket knife. Although known in nearly all parts of New Zealand by the name of Stagknife, the game was also known as Bites, 

Jackknife, Stabknife, Knifey, Momley Peg, and Throwing the Knife. ... There were generally two players ... who each sought to deflect the point of the pocket knife from certain parts of the body by a flick of the hand in such a way that the blade would stick firmly into the ground. ... Every movement had to be done three times. [172] Typical movements were: (1) Place the open pocket knife (loose) [name of movement] [sic] on the closed knuckles of the right hand, point the knife towards the thumb, then with a quick upward flick of the hand to the left, deflect the point of the knife into the ground.

Quote:  The critics will no doubt note that to oozle and to trickle, which denoted much slower modes of locomotion, were comparatively little [30] used, and will not be surprised that Wellington trampers are sometimes afflicted with perspidrip, or describe themselves as jagged. Jagged (one syllable), worn out by exertion, exhausted, no doubt has some relation to the English dialect on the jag, a drunken spree, and the American jagged, tipsy, and also owes something to jiggered.

Quote:  I refer to the claim that the jandal was "invented" by Maurice Yock in the mid 1950s. He may have made up the name and trademarked it, but he did not invent the footwear. The jandal, commonly known as the flip flop in the United Kingdom, the thong in Australia and mainland United States (although since the popularity of the thong swimwear/underwear, flip flop is bcoming more common in the US) and the slippah or slipper in Hawaii, has been around for thousands of years. Flip flops first appeared in the UK around 2000 years ago, most likelt brought over by the Romans, who probably got them from the Egyptians, who had them from around 3000BC. The Allied Forces took the Japanese Zori sandal (which the Japanese had been wearing for thousands of years) back to the US after World War II, and it gained popularity among California's surfers in the early 1950s. All of which happened before Yock abbreviated the name to jandal.

Quote:  Jandal, like champagne, like Hoover, should never be used as a generic term. Jandals, flip-flops, thongs - they're all a ghastly sort of topless shoe hitched to the foot with a piece of rubber between big and second toes, but call a common thong a Jandal and you're in for trouble with the Napier company holding the trademark. Jandals were born in the 1950s, an adaptation of casual slip-ons worn by the Japanese team at the 1956 Olympic Games.

Quote:  They've been an icon of Kiwi slobbery since the '50s but in the summer of 2001, the jandal has become a hot fashion item, far removed from the grubby rubber models sported by beer-gutted blokes at barbies.... [Maurice] Yock, a New Zealand sales rep who worked for his grandfather's company, was travelling around Asia in the late '50s when he spotted a style of footwear in Japan. The "jandal" - from "Japanese sandal" - went into production in a garage in Te Papapa in 1957, and Jandals Ltd was born, a brand name specific to this country.

Quote:  I am intrigued by the word "japie", sometimes "jaapie" which is often used in New Zealand for South Africans. I have asked South African expatriates about the word and their theory was that it stemmed from a characteristic pronunciation of "yeah", a word they often use. Some believe it is an ironic pun on "yuppie".



In Afrikaans, the name Japie is a diminutive or affectionate form of Jaap or Jacobus.. In everyday use, a japie is a dolt or simpleton. It is often used together with the word "plaas" as in "plaasjapie", which means a yokel or country bumpkin... If the word is South African in origin, "jaapie" would be the wrong spelling. The "a" as in japie is a long vowel.

Quote:  A jigger was simply a slab of white pine or rimu, axe-trimmed to a diameter of about six inches by three inches deep, and slightly thinner toward the extremity. In the end nearest the tree was bolted a forked piece of steel made by a blacksmith, which had a point or boss on the upper side. This was secured to the board by small bolts and covered with sacking. The bushman commonly cut a neat hole in the tree about level with his breast, or even higher. Into this little chamber the bushman pushed the steel head of the jigger, elevating the tail and striking his axe into the trunk, and aided by vines climbed up till he stood upright on the jigger, whose boss, or spike, pushed into the upper part of the axe cavity, made a springy and secure chopping platform. An expert man would easily cut his stance and attach his jigger in three minutes - a very much quicker method than the old style of collecting tree fern trunks and building a platform.

The front seat accomodated the driver and two passengers; the back seat carried three passengers, back to back with those in front, with their feet on a narrow footboard. The whole was covered by a tilt.

[18] These jingles were ugly, uncomfortable vehicles, having two wheels with a long axle, over which was built the body, containing two seats running parallel with the axle each capable of

holding four persons. The whole was surmounted with a clumsy roof held up by supports at the sides, and attached thereto were curtains which could be let down in wet weather. The seats were placed back to back, and the seat in the rear was reached by a step in the middle of the footboard.

In Tig round the school, you `jinked' and turned back. We played it to warm us up, but it was a dangerous game. (1860; Taieri)

In the four-wheeled jinker the hind wheels are much larger than the front pair and the two axles are joined by a central longitudinal beam, under which the tree trunk is slung by means of chains. The two-wheeled jinker has a bow-shaped axle, to which one end of the trunk is slung, the other being allowed to drag on the ground. The 

jinker, slightly modified, is sometimes used for moving wooden buildings.

used as another method [besides the catamaran] of moving logs but was not popular on steep grades having a tendency to overrun the bullock team. On flat land however this method was quite satisfactory as the near end of the log dragged along the ground and acted as a brake. ... Jinker restored by Mr Reg Poyner

Wellington team's Joey Club has been trying to `nail' K.F. Gray, who is to tour with the All Blacks.  The club awards its Joey emblem to the player who, in the judgement of the reserves, makes the biggest `Joe' of himself during the match.

Quote:  As [the diggers] descried us approaching on the rocks, a simultaneous cry of `Joe! Joe!' was raised. This is a popular cry on the New Zealand diggings and is used to hail any `new chums'

who may appear. It had its origin in the Australian diggings, where licences were granted to all who held claims, and those who worked without were liable to be apprehended and punished. When the police came upon the ground, to inspect licences, the cry of `Joe!' was raised, and whenever the pass-word was given a thousand voices echoed the cry, until it passed over the

fields, when those who had no licences made their escape as quickly as possible.

Quote:  More passengers were picked up along the road, and one of them, a returning digger, enlivened the trip by calling out `Joe' to any passing new chum, followed by a series of kind inquiries, and wound up with a loud laugh. The term was originally applied to the goldfields police in Victoria, who made themselves unpopular hunting for licences.

Quote:  As this was the first time such a thing had been attempted on those diggings, I had to undergo a tremendous fire of `Joes' from every chum I passed. The word `Joe' expresses the derision usually bestowed on new chums on the diggings, or any man acting, or dressing, or speaking in any way considered as outre [e-acute] by the diggers themselves. ... Times getting dull about the Six-mile, I was joined one by one by many others, several of whom had been among the first to `Joe' me at the beginning.

[a pneumatic-tyre car-wheeled trap or dray.] <i>Ibid.</i> 145  Horse and ox are still the principal means of haulage, and the islanders have invented a conveyance that overcomes the worse features of the bog - the so-called jogger. This is a cart-like vehicle with two pneumatic tyres - something like a rubber-tyred Roman chariot - drawn by two sturdy mud-trained horses.

Quote:  Only four vehicles were in use on the island up until this time but by 1952 over 100 were in use. [59] Before the coming of motorised transport, the mode of transportation was the `Chatham Island Truck' (Konake), a wooden flat-decked horse or bullock-drawn vehicle, with iron or wooden wheels at the back and sledge runners on the front. Also in use was the `jogger' a cartlike vehicle with two pneumatic-tyred wheels, seating about three people and drawn by two horses attached to a shaft. They worked on the principle of the African Cape Cart. The pole (shaft) was attached to the collars of the horses. Tom McClurg of Te Whakuru made the first `jogger' in 

Chathams, about 1940.

`Jolly' is an English word, meaning to `deceive' and `take down,' and that the position concealed guns which made havoc of the Turks. (2) That `Jolly' is a corruption of an Indian word - a case similar to `Blighty.'  Anyway, who was Johnston? The only facts which seem to be agreed on are that the place was never `Johnston's,' and certainly never `jolly.'

Quote:  The gum-spear, a slender, rapier-like instrument, fitted with an ordinary spade handle, varied in length from about three feet for use in shallow ground, to twenty-five or more for working deep

swamps. Some time after its introduction, the spear came to be fitted with what was called the `joker,' or `toggle'. This was a coil of fine wire, bound round the spear [50] a few inches from the point. It allowed the spear to be thrust into the ground with the minimum of resistance, there being no `drag' on the shaft. It is said that the forerunner of the `joker' was discovered by accident. A digger, pushing his spear into the ground, found that it had penetrated a boot-eyelet, and was surprised to find that, instead of forming an obstruction, the spear penetrated the ground more easily; the coil of fine wire was devised as an improvement. An experienced digger could detect at once, by the feel, and the resistance met by the spear, whether he had struck timber, a stone or gum.

Quote:  Numbers of Americans who spent sufficient time in New Zealand found themselves adopting a word from which escape is almost impossible. It is  none other than joker ..... New Zealanders, however, have given it a wider meaning; a joker is simply a man, and he is not necessarily a humorous fellow ..... Thus a New Zealander will say, `Who's that joker?' ...... This word crept in to the vocabulary of many Americans Down Under, but they will forget it when they settle 

down at home again. The American use of the word guy has exactly the same meaning.

Quote:  Among colloquialisms, joker (32)[per 500,000 counted words in Queensland] in the sense of `man' is not confined to Australia, though more frequent there than in England. In the Queenland count  it was less common than chap (409) or bloke (176), but it would be likely to rank higher in New Zealand, where it is very common not only alone but in the phrases  you jokers and a decent joker (a  general term of approval). It is used (repeated as he) as an equivalent  of an absolute indefinite pronoun, corresponding to standard one. `They ask one if one is serious' becomes `They ask a joker if he is serious'. With a negative verb it replaces no one. `No one can remember everything' would be colloquially `a joker can't remember everything' '

In Perano whaling practice, it mostly referred to an `outsider', `stranger', or `non-whaler', who was deemed to have brought bad luck to their whaling. The Jonah might be blamed for the non-sighting of whales. Jonahs were never welcomed at the Perano whaling lookout, or on board any Perano ships. Not all strangers were regarded as Jonahs; some, in fact, who helped bring good luck were credited with being good omens.

Quote:  Judas goats are proving a strong ally in DOC's quest to remove feral goats from areas of conservation land in the Wellington region. In a first for Wellington Conservancy, goats fitted with tracking devices were released into Pukaha Mount Bruce and parts of Tararua Forest Park to sek out goats which have eluded DOC goat hunters and their dogs... Since the operation began late last year seven judas goats have tracked down 14 wild goats in the western Tararuas...

Quote:  The 'Judas' goat is fitted with a collar that has an antenna attached. It is then lowered into the forest by helicopter and because goats are social animals the Judas goat will find other goats. Later, the hunters' [sic] return by helicopter to the area and, using radio equipment, locate the Judas goat by picking up the signal from its antenna. The helicopter drops a hunter and dog on the ground to track the goats and shoot them.
