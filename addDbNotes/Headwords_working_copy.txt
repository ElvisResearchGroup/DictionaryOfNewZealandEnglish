4560	copper Maori	1	1	1	Copper Maori seems to have been used by Europeans in the North Island (esp. Northland) for the more usual hangi, umu. with <I>copper</I>. The Maori suffix (variously spelt in early texts) is curious. (1) It is used both with its flexionless Maori pl and its anglicised pl in -s. (2) If it is an aj, the placement after the noun follows Maori grammatical usage: a fuller anglicisation would be <I>Maori copper</I>, occas. used. (3) Williams (p?) states that <I>Maori aj and n `native, belonging to New Zealand' is a comparatively recent use not recorded before 1850, and probably first used by Maoris themselves. Is this an early Maori use of the modern sense of Maori? Or an early Pakeha use? (4) Or is it a use of the sense `normal, usual, ordinary' <I>- kopa Maori</I> being the usual earth-oven, perhaps distinct from the iron tripot etc., (then called in English `copper'), the <I>*kopa Pakeha; </I>	1	1	1	hangi, umu			tdeverson		2/13/2010	2	1	0

132	Native	1	12	1	Used within New Zealand, in competition with the more specific New Zealand, Maori to denote especially fauna (including human fauna) and flora considered indigenous. It is now (1984) an obsolescent or non-preferred use, chiefly because of the felt derogatory application to people and things Maori (cf the change in 1947 from Department of  `Native Affairs' to `Maori Affairs', and such shifts as native earth oven amended to earth oven between the sixth (1957) and  seventh (1971) editions of Williams Dictionary (Umu 1 p467); and also of greater feeling of identity  among born New Zealanders expressing itself in a more specific descriptive term `New Zealand'. (Shifts such as  native bush to indigenous forest are an example of vernacular or common as against technical or `professional' forestry usage: the  latter being the converse of exotic forest.)   The New Zealand non-specificity of native can be seen in its Australian applications (see Morris), and is illustrated by OED 13c. `In the names of Australian animals and birds in the names of Australian plants, fruits, etc.'  	1	1	1			J.A. Andersen's comments (`Popular Names of New Zealand Plants': 1926 Tr NZI 662) still hold: `The word `native' has been prefixed to almost as many names as the words `New Zealand .... This word may perhaps be descriptive if used within New Zealand and between New Zealanders; but if used outside - say in Australia - its meaning will be quite changed; for should the New Zealander speak of `native teak' the Australian would think not of a New Zealand but of an Australian tree. The confusion might be avoided were the word `Maori' used instead of the word `native', and indeed, instead of the long double `New Zealand'. See also 1933 Acland's note on indigenous.

The restrictions on uniforms mentioned below were brought in to prevent big firms outspending the smallones by providing splendiferous uniforms. Organisations outside the rag trade do not seem to have been allowed in officially into Interhouse Marching until about 1954.  Despite the evidence below that it started in Auckland under Jean Stevenson, Bateman's Encyclopedia says marching started in Wellington and spread to Auckland later.  It must be wrong. The plot thickens. Passing through London Bookshop today I spotted Gordon Ell's new book on NZ Trivia and Kiwiana and he says Marching Girls started in Dunedin in the 1920s. have I found any early Auckland ones, nothing before 1941 in Wellington. guess is that one or other or both of Jean Stevenson and Kathleen Montgomery started them in Auckland and through the YWCA spread them rapidly throughout the main centres.  	tdeverson		2/16/2010	2	1	0

What's that, Sackville?), possibly reinforced in some areas by a use of the Maori interrogative n&emacr. produces a typical and frequent form: positive statement +  particle eh? or eh! You're going to town, eh(?)  J. Devanny Old Savage 1927 uses both the general English (negative) and the NZ (positive) use as part of her style (check pages 104 `aye').

4662	nugget 	1	1	1	a boot polish (from trademark), usually thought of as black; now any bootpolish; 	1	1	1		-	1984 Orsman letter to an enquirer Nugget `boot polish' is a New Zealand and Australian word used, I think, from before the First World War. Eric Partridge in his A Dictionary of Slang gives it as Australian colloquial from about 1910 - the date he thought he first remembered it from. I have it in my collections, but have no early date for it as I have not yet checked it up in advertisements of old newspapers, nor written to the company that produces it to ask them when they adopted  Nugget as a brand-name, and why. I assume it comes from nugget `a small lump', as in nugget of gold. Perhaps you or the class might like to write to the Nugget company and ask them about this. It's also now used as a verb - `to nugget shoes ', for example. It's like many other brand-names that have passed into common speech: e.g. hoover for `vacuum cleaner': to hoover a room, etc.  	tdeverson		12/7/2006	2	1	0

Many of the one-woman brothel keepers ran their front shops, as well as their prostitution trade, as regular business enterprises, selling merchandise as any other retailer would. The association between the legitimate frontage and the activity in the back rooms also reflected what Ann-Louise Shapiro has termed the 'polymorphous world of commerce and sexuality' which infused urban life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.	tdeverson		1/29/2007	2	1	0

Any time a pass is incomplete, intercepted, knocked-down, or contacts an out-of-bounds area, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate change of possession of the disc. A goal is scored when a player successfully passes the disc to a teammate in the endzone which that team is attacking.	1	1	1			definition from Ultilingo.com (http://mypage.direct.ca/r/rulegal/all.html)	tdeverson		11/18/2006	2	1	0

9130	shellfish	1	1	1		1	1	1			An Australian lexicographer points out there is a difference between most dictionary definitions and what the public see as a shellfish; likewise in NZ the fishery regulations define for their convenience shellfish as including, from memory, crayfish, sponges and possibly even sea-grass. The sensible thing would be to redefine using as the basic definition the scientific one. The present OED definition is: Any animal living in water whose outer covering is a shell, whether testaceous, as an oyster, or crustaceous, as a crab. This wording is followed by Random House and Macquarie whereas the general public and scientists tend to think of a shellfish as a member of the class Mollusca, i.e. mostly animals with a hard calcareous shell or shells.	tdeverson		10/30/2007	2	1	0

What we had instead were various amendments to the National Service Emergency Regulations promulgated first in 1940, when they referred mainly to the Services and spoke of Placement Officers and which I suspect were the "Manpower  Regulations" of the time.  The first relevant regulation seems to be 1942 Statutory Regulations 5/19 The National Service Emergency Regulations 1940, Amendment No. 8: There shall from time to time be appointed.. such number of District Man-power Officers as may be required. Ibid. 21. In any essential undertaking.. (a) Except with the permission in writing of the District Man-power Officer, the employer shall not terminate.. the employment of any person for the time being employed therein.. except in case of emergency... (b) Except with the permission in writing of the District Man-power Officer, no person for the time being employed in the undertaking shall leave his employment... Ibid. 24.

See Family Protection Act 1908, and now Family Protection Act 1955. A similar scheme in England, introduced in 1926, is known as <i>family provision</i>.

The land transfer system was based on the <i>Torrens system</I> first introduced in South Australia in 1858. That term (which NSOD records) is occasionally used in NZ as a synonym.

8186	laundry	1	1	1	a room in a house used principally for washing and (since the advent of clothes dryers) drying clothes and linen. 	1	1	1			Jim writes : In relation to places this is much the most common use of the word in NZ. Not in DNZE or - in this sense - NZPOD but recognised in NZ Oxford Paperback. NSOD defines <i>laundry</i> as an establishment where clothes etc are laundered, Collins as a place where clothes and linen are washed and ironed, which encompasses the NZ use but is unspecified. In most modern houses in England clothes are washed in the kitchen and there is no separate room. In NZ until recently bylaws prohibited washing clothes in a room used for preparing food. <i>Laundry</i> is known in England in the NZ sense but seems uncommon. In a 1987 Property supplement to a Midlands newspaper it rarely appeared in the detailed house descriptions and always as an attributive - <i>laundry area, laundry room</i>. The term <i>laundry room</i> appears in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> 2000. The Australian situation (and word) was similar to the NZ one according to Hudson <i>Modern Australian usage</i>. MAU p223. Macquarie 1981 is consistent with this. Salmond  <i>Old NZ Houses</i>p. 200 suggests that the change of name from wash-house to laundry was associated with the advent of the bungalow style i.e. c1910-1920. Cf <i>porch</i>. But see <i>wash-house</i>. The same book implies (anachronistically?) a possible much earlier use  "Until the 1880s... water was heated... in the laundry copper for washing clothes and for the children's weekly bath." p. 143. Two house plans (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 198-99) are of interest. One dated 1930 has a "washhouse" under the same roof as the house; the other dated 1924 has a basement "laundry".	tdeverson		11/28/2006	2	1	0
8187	Marseille tile	1	1	1	a burnt-clay roofing tile, commonly used esp. on bungalows and State House. 	1	1	1			Jim writes: Introduced to NZ about 1901 and imported until 1924, after which they were made locally. See Salmond <i>Old NZ Houses</i> p 122 etc. An account of the development of the Marseilles tile roof in Australia is in Robin Boyd <i>Australia's Home</i> p. 151-153. Despite its European name and the original provenance of the tile, this term is not in British dictionaries I have seen. NSOD has only <i>Marseille ware</i> - a type of pottery produced in Marseilles during the 17th and 18th centuries. DEH adds: researching family geneology, I encountered a ship from Marseilles via Genoa to Sydney or NZ in 1909 from Marseille with a cargo of tiles.

8188	one-way	1	12	1		1	1	1			Jim writes : Dictionaries define <i>one-way</i> in relation to traffic as allowing travel in one direction only. This does not cover the common NZ one-way bridge, across which a vehicle may travel in either direction unless there is opposing traffic. That is, it can be crossed only one way at a time. Although the distinction is a fine one, it seems real. Possibly the term <i>one-way bridge</i> is itself distinctive NZE.

7409	waka	1	1	1	a confederation of iwi	1	1	1			"Maori iwi are usually grouped into confederations, which are named after ancestral canoes (i.e.waka) which are said to have come from Hawaiki. The best known are Tainui and Arawa, but there are others (and I can't help noticing the recent term for Northland confederation is Tai Tokerau which is not a canoe). The use arises because traditionally a  Maori might have a number of iwi affiliations.  (I was once told that when asked their iwi in the Muruwhenua area, locals tend to look down at the ground and give the iwi in whose rohe they are standing, because they belong to all the Muriwhenua iwi). Thus the waka in the quotations [in <i>Kotare</i>]presumably refer to the notion of waka as confederations - which is not a bad way to think of political parties. And waka jumping is I take as heinous as announcing you are Arawa rather than the Tainui you once proclaimed (in the middle of a battle). (Brian Easton, 12/12/1999)	tdeverson		11/29/2006	2	1	0
7256	bulkie	1	1	1	shortened form of "bulk tonnage operator"	1	1	1			King (24/3/1999) says bulk tonnage operators were firms which developed from the 1960 in reaction to the then regulations limiting road competition with rail. These firms consolidated small lots of goods into wagon lot, thus creating "bulk" goods (from the Railways perspective) out of much smaller units. Their workers did not in fact "load bulk goods" - it was the result of their working that the goods became "bulk". Such firms still exist; their current formal name is "freight forwarders" although one hears bulk tonnage operatore or "BTO" occasionally. Examples include Mainfreight and Daily Freight... Given that the expanded name of "bulk tonnage operator" is some thirty years older than [your] example, I would be surprised if its contraction is not also somewhere recorded earlier than 1991.	dhurley		8/29/2000	0	1	0

This sense is recorded in Macquarie 1981 and AMO and has been long familiar to me. [me also - DEH]. The relevant NSOD definition is less specific - "goods of a quality second and inferior to the best." Collins is similar. NZPOD following POD defines seconds as "inferior goods". If British usage accords with these definitions, this sense of the word may be distinctly NZ and AusE.			11/9/2000	0	1	0

Any similar usages in the Northern Hemisphere (none are recorded in NSOD or Collins) are likely to relate to the summer solstice, since the winter solstice coincides with Christmas. I havs also seen <i>winter Christmas</i> used in NZ. The development of "solstice" terms might usefully be watched.	gkennedy		6/10/2006	2	1	0

It is also more medically diagnosed these days - e.g. it is attributed to salmonella or campylobacter or even giardia. It has been associated with the collection of rainwater from house roofs - that can be contaminated by bird droppings.   	dbardsl		5/9/2007	2	1	0

But I recall it from the 30s (and later?) as the name for a child's cloth sunhat made with an extension at the back to protect the neck. I have found no citations, however. DEH adds: I remember these. I think they disappeared when troops returned from the Middle East and the cult of protection from the sun gave way to the cult of the sun.

The definition of a health centre in NSOD and Collins, is premises owned by a local authority providing health care, usually housing a group practice, nursing staff, etc. premises.

8087	porch	1	1	1		1	1	1			Jim writes: The question is whether the <i>British</i> use of porch is also wider than the dictionaries suggest. The absence of the terms sunporch etc from these dictionaries may be significant. I have noticed two (apparently) wider uses in Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Tolkien p.246 - "Now they had time simply to sit and talk especially on summer evenings after supper, on a bench in the front pocrch of Sandfield Road." [This is interesting for the author's phrase <i>in the porch</i>, whereas we would normally say <i>on the porch</i>. Also in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> p. 213. A 1987 Midlands Property Supplement has porch only in the sense of entrance porch (and then seldom); one or two ads have the term <i>storm porch</i> which was new to me. (Although porch and verandah are partly interchangeable, I think that the covered entrance to a meeting house - whare tipuna, wharenui - is always in English "porch", although it extends for the full width of the building.)			11/8/2000	0	1	0

8080	group housing	1	1	1		1	1	1			Jim writes: Hist. (mainly 1950s). A cluster of terms associated with the <i>group housing scheme</i> introduced in 1953 whereby numbers of low-cost houses in a subdivision were built by a private builder for sale - <i>group house, group housing, group builder</I>. Often the State developed the subdivision and provided services, selling the developed block to a private builder. The scheme offered home ownership as an alternative to State rental houses and was very popular... These terms are not recorded in DNZE. Note - 1. Of possible linguistic interest is the official use in this context of the term <i>block</i> in the sense of an area subdivided for group (or State) housing and <i>site</i> (not <i>lot</i>) in the sense of an individual section in such a block. There is no trace in the literature I have seen of the English term <i>housing estate</i>. 2. Group houses are associated in my recollection with <i>parades of homes</I>, at which the variety of homes in a group housing block were open for inspection by prospective buyers. This term seems to extend slightly the ordinary meanings of <i>parade</i> and is possibly a distinctive NZE compound.	tdeverson		4/9/2010	2	1	0
8081	hall	1	1	1	any corridor, passage or extended landing in a house.	1	1	1			Jim writes NZPOD (but not DNZE) records this extended NZ use. In BritE it seems to be limited in this sense to what we would specifically call a <i>front hall</i> - an area into which the front door opens. I can support this by an anecdote of a minor domestic catastrophe. My wife (who grew up in England) asked my son to strip the wallpaper in the hall, by which she meant the front hall. He did this but went on to deal with a passage at the top of the stairs!			11/7/2000	0	1	0

4063	Winebox	1	1	1		1	1	1			The term arose when about Sep/Oct 1992 Mr Stephen Lunn of Auckland put some documents into a cardboard winebox and then released them to the public.

When faced with a court writ on publication, the Independent ran a fable on a mythical country called [South] Wogistan in which the basic details were revealed. The term Wogistan is said by the Independent in last week's issue in a column by Chalkie (? Berryman) to have gained some currency in circles interested in the Winebox affair and may be worth picking up - I have the references. It's very PC. The first published use of the term wine box of documents may have been made by Paul East in Parliament [NZPD, p. 539] 	tdeverson		11/24/2006	2	1	0

C26 "Suburb Cops Zero in on Ring Involved in Home Invasions" and believes there would be much earlier examples; his earliest was a 1978 article in a trade magazine about credit cards. Michael Proffitt (mproffitt@oup.co.uk) has this from 1988 Sara Paretsky <i>Toxic Shock</i> (1990) xxix. 214 "The steel-lined door I'd had installed after my last home invasion had held" and says they have Canadian evidence from 1993 and "home invasion" and "home invader" from Australian newspapers from 1994 onwards. Wayne Glowka (Georgia College & State University; wglowka@mail.gcsu.edu) has a Canadian usage from 1997 <i>Globe and Mail</i> 9 Dec. p. A7 "The terms home invasion or reesidential robbery surfaced in Winnipeg about 18 months ago after a series of violent break-ins where seniors, who happened to be at home at the time, were injured."

In the DNZE p. 103 you deal with the word 'bung' which can mean become useless, broken, ruined and 'bung out' meaning to die. But your earliest reference for these words is 1887 and the origin is given as Australian pidgin. I wonder what the earliest Australian reference is and whether Rangihaeata would have picked it up from this source so early. It seems that if he was using it, then it already had some currency in NZ by then." Harry Orsman replied that "I think (and I can recall this from the limits of an imperfect memory) that this use in early Maori-Pakeha New Zealand relations was a pidgin word from 'bang(a)bang' meaning to shoot. It wasn't related to the Aboriginal word usually spelled 'bung' 'dead', etc."	tdeverson		9/12/2007	2	1	0

The term is not unique to NZ; there were resident magistrates in Ireland and elsewhere, but never in England. They played a significant part in NZ History which is recounted in Aland Ward <i>A Show of Justice</i> (1974). Not recorded in DNZE or other dictionaries, except perfunctorily (without definition) in NSOD.	tdeverson		4/26/2010	2	1	0
7601	restraining order	1	1	1	a court order aimed at preventing the harassment of persons who are not in a domestic relationship with the harasser.	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes : Introduced by the Harassment Act 1997, it is a milder counterpart to a <i>protection order</i> under the Domestic Violence Act.

7602	sexual violation	1	1	1	any non-consensual sexual connection	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes : This crime was introduced in 1985 so that an accused is charged with sexual violation and not with rape or sodomy. (<I>Rape</I> is however retained in the definition of the crime). The term is not specifically recorded in NSOD, Collins or ODL, and it has a precise legal meaning in NZ that is not replicated in England. See Crimes Act 1961, s 128	tdeverson		5/30/2010	2	1	0

7605	special vote	1	1	1	a vote cast at a parliamentary election otherwise than at a polling place in the voter's own electorate on election day, by a voter whose name is on a printed electoral roll.	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes : the term was introduced in 1956 (now Electoral Act 1993) and includes votes cast before polling day, overseas votes and votes at polling places outside the home electorate. Similar arrangemnents in other countries appear to have different names. Also special (elliptical)	tdeverson		5/27/2010	2	1	0
7606	supervision	1	1	1	a sentence introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1985 to replace release on probation.	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes : It subjects the offender to the oversight and control of a probation officer. <i>Supervision</i> in England is primarily a welfare order placing a child under local authority or probation officer supervision, although it may also be an adjunct to a suspended sentence. Note that the term <i>probation order</i> is no longer used in NZ, but <i>probation officer</i> is, and that <i>pre-sentence report</i> corresponds to the English <i>social inquiry report</i>.	tdeverson		11/6/2007	2	1	0

(British road atlases use the term <i>passing place</i>. For a time recently there were <i>passing bays</i> on the Rimutaka Hill road).

The backed horse would be given the perfect run in behind a nominated pacemaker. Other horses would be ridden into deadend passages or taken wide in the run home. Occasionally an uncooperative pacemaking horse would 'bolt' on its jockey and win the race - and lose large betting plunges that had been made on the intended victor." >Google search showed in used in Australia also and to a lesser degree also UK, the Netherlands.	rscholes		3/18/2006	2	1	0

7497	radiator	1	1	1	a radiant electric heater	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes: In the sense of a radiant electric heater, Collins records this as <i>Austral & NZ</i>. This was the ordinary NZ term for this object at least up to the 1960s. A notice published in the press in 3/00 mentions <i>electric radiator</i>. Not in DNZE or NZPOD Also often called <i>bar heater</I>.	tdeverson		11/29/2006	2	1	0
7502	scotia	1	1	1	a (usually concave) moulding between a wall and a ceiling.	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes: NSOD, Collins and Chambers define <i>scotia</i> as a concave/hollow moulding, esp. at the base of an (ionic) column. The OED definition is "a hollow moulding = casement". The latest citation (1878) reads "another kind of base is frequent in which a bead is subsituted for the scotia". <i>Casement</I> in turn is defined in the relevant sense as "a hollow moulding, a cavetto, not exceding one quarter round". <i>Cavettos</i>, it appears, are "principally used in cornices". All this is a bit obscure, but the definitions in NSOD etc would suggest a fairly uncommon word. The ordinary NZ use is specialised though common, and familar to most homeowners - a (usually concave) moulding between a wall and a ceiling. In NZ, it is standard and as well-known as <i>skirting board</i>.	dhurley		12/20/2000	0	1	0

DEH notes large brooms known as shed brooms were also used in cowsheds to sweep down the shed after milking as far back as the 1930s.	tdeverson		5/23/2010	2	1	0

NZSOD gives <i>spit chips</i> as <i>Aust.</i>. Neither word is in DNZE or NZ Slang. My impression is that <i>spit tacks</i> is the more usual expression in NZ and it is the variant I use mself.

Not in OED DEH notes that to the best of his knowledge he has never heard flag day used in NZ except in English books (and comics) - always <i>street days</i> or <i>street appeals</i> or <i>street appeal days</i>	tdeverson		5/23/2010	2	1	0
7512	stud	1	1	1	the height of a room between floor and ceiling	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes : NSOD gives this as <i>orig. and chiefly US</i>; OED as US with 1850 and 1886 citations. Not in Collins, and this suggests it may be uncommon in England. NZPOD records it (3b) in a more complex way. It is the standard word in NZ for expressing internal height.	dhurley		12/21/2000	0	1	0

7514	lounge suite	1	1	1	a set of lounge furniture	1	1	1			Jim Cameron writes : OED defines the word as "a set of furniture of the same pattern, frequently with reference to 2 armchairs and a sofa". NSOD & Collins define the word in this sense as "esp. of 2 armchairs and a settee." NZPOD following English POD gives "a sofa and armchairs of the same design." This is usually called a <i>lounge suite</i> in NZ, a term not recorded in the British dictionaries. The NZ use of suite ordinarily encompasses also a <i>dining suite</i> and a <i>bedroom suite</i>. (I have seen bedroom suite used in an English mystery novel published a few years ago). See furniture store ads in any newspaper or circular. In NZ, the meaning of <i>suite</i> by itself would be uncertain except in context.	tdeverson		11/6/2007	2	1	0

The booklet "by Gray and Becht" has the words "All White" in the title only. It was also "edited by Paul Elenio". It has no precise date but could have preceded the first newspaper reference. c). Nat. Lib. does not have Sunday Star or Christchurch Star for May 1892. d). The first Dominion ref. (13 May) is an article by Gray. The second ref (20 May) is a Press Association message. e). My betting is that Gray did originate the term; would be worth ringing him at the Dom to confirm. I could not find it any earlier than 13 May - before that and elsewhere after that references are to Kiwis or the New Zealand team.	jan		9/29/2010	2	1	0

2323	wheelie bin	1	1	1	a large refuse bin on wheels	1	1	1			I suspect wheelie-bin appears to be Oz but Can-Plan being a local trade-name is NZ. The only American words that come near I can find are trash can and garbage can but I would still suspect that it was the Americans who first put them on wheels, probably in California where they have longer drives than in New York. The Oxford Dictionary of New Words (1991) has it as "a large refuse bin on wheels; a Eurobin. The wheelie bin first appeared in the UK about 1986, but both the object and the name seem to have been used in Australia for some years before that". However, the only Oz dictionary I could find it in was Macquarie 3rd edition, no quotes, no dates but it gives as alternative names "Otto" or "Otto bin" and "Sulo" or "Sulo bin", both being trade-names à la Can-Plan. In our street where every second person is on Can-Plan, we tend now to say "The neighbour has got his can-plan out". The Yellow Pages for Wellington give a number of variants : handikarts, wheelie carts, daily karts, care carts, handcarts, wheely bin, wheelibin. **OED online: 4. Special Comb. wheelie bin orig.

One of your cits suggests Patagonian but no Patagonian dictionaries around. Meteorological dictionaries ignore it although they touch on willy-willy. Otherwise, it is just one of their unspecified "local winds". However, the attached dictionary entry seems to have a lot of sense, particularly the statement that it was common 18th Century oral nautical usage, to which can be added "preserved in some of these localities where these winds occur.	dhurley		11/25/1999	0	1	-1

3053	neenish tart	1	1	1		1	1	1			A small round short-pastry tart with a custard filling but especially characterised by the icing, half of which is black and half white; in Dunedin with a peppermint flavour (check). Other variations in the filling include lemon juice, rum essence or vanilla. Known to me from Dunedin in 1952. An Australian version (see below) is on a biscuit base instead of being in a tart and includes a layer of jam but has the essential bicoloured icing. Possible origins of the name : Nimes (in France); Neen in Shropshire (Neenton, Neen Savage, Neen Sollars); have been told of a Dutch woman making them. There is an outside chance it might be related to the neem tree ("a meliaceous tree of India and Ceylon, sometimes 50 feet high... The natives chew its small twigs and use them as tooth brushes") but I think not. David Burton does not mention them in his books on the raj. Kathryn Walls knows the lemon-flavoured variety from Invercargill (thought they were bakery rather than home-made), Vincent had heard of them, Bill Manhire hadn't. Nelson Wattie does not know them from NZ but when the bicoloured icing was described said he knew them from Germany as "Americans", possibly because of the black and white racial suggestion. Tony Simpson makes, them, his mother made them, his grandmother made them, but he doesn't know anything about the origin. The name appears as a headword in the Macquarie Dictionary but none other that I can find. None of the books on the cookery shelves at National Library has them, not do any of the present stock of second-hand ones in Quilter's but then most modern cookery books are written (or compiled) by restaurant chefs who do not bake and not by bakery cooks. 	tdeverson		2/10/2010	2	1	0

2009	Native title	1	1	1	= Maori title	1	1	1			NATIVE [MAORI] (CUSTOMARY) TITLE. A fascinating and still proceeding investigation. The phrase is not defined in the acts - Native is but not Native Title. There are at least two types of Native (Maori) title - customary, which I presume means communal (of the iwi), and freehold.  There will undoubtedly be more colloquial references in second readings to bills.  The earliest reference is quoted from "1847 NZPCC 387 n at 390" which I will need to consult with a lawyer about - the book in question doesn't have an explanation of NZPCC.

But the senses also parallel those of words with similar meanings: to wipe (off) (a person or thing), get wiped; wash out (sthg), a wash-out; to write off (sbdy or sthg), a write-off. The word seems noticeable after WW2, so perhaps it was popularised by NZ servicemen who may have picked it up from British Servicemen (or Australians): cf P.4.

(There seems a distict cleavage between early South Island and early NI usage, cf. burn v1. In the South Island `a burn' was a periodical burning off of old tussock to prepare the way for good crop of new grass. In 20th century usage, however, has been applied (e.g. in the Pelorus Sounds) to burning off noxious weeds, fern, scrub etc. to get a good growth of green feed (cf. match-farming). In the North Island, `a burn' was chiefly applied to clearing away (felled) bush by burning, a burning off (or over) of unwanted bush: that is, to clearing or bringing land into cultivation, not merely to improving pasture. burn off seems chiefly used in this North Island sense (cf bush-burning)) 	1	1	1	also bush burn			tdeverson		9/13/2007	2	1	0

It's my recollection (DEH) that the same phrase was used then also by racing commentators and it was transferred to the winner of any competitive event. Partridge ("A Dictionary of Catch Phrases") discusses "home and hosed" as an Aus. variant of "home and dried on the pig's back."

First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is passed through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch.' `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `pitch.' 			3/11/2003	0	1	0

The ordinary man in the paddock in Canterbury recognises only three winds: <i> East </i> (from N.E.),<i> sou'wester </i> (from S.E., S. etc, S.W. etc), and nor'wester. <i> As a matter of fact a three-day so'wester usually only lasts two and a half. They are said to be less fierce than in the early days, just as the nor'wester is said to have been softened by the planting on the plains. It may be so in Christchurch </i>; but I cannot say I notice any difference up-country. The <i> nor'</i> wester <i> may come from any where between due north and due west. In such places as Hororata, where the wind can get at you between two gorges a distinction is made between a Waimakariri and a Rakaia nor' wester; but both are called nor' westers. </i>	1	1	1			Empty but for the note under definition	jan		1/18/2011	2	1	0

31887	Maori	1	1	12		1	1	1			There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i> was fresh-water, oridinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.) The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers. 	gkennedy		5/25/2006	2	1	0
