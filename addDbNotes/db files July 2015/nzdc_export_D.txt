Quote: She was always told that dag was  Southland rhyming slang for wag, which latter seemed to her mostly used in the North Island at any rate. But the early use (now obs) of Dag! as an expletive (related to Doggon!), from  1917 and Dag at `a dab at' may have some bearing on reinforcement. The probable origin is in EDD n2., v2. 11. a daring feat among boys Ches w Mid w Som: e.g. Som `set a dag: perform some feat in such a way as to challenge imitation ... saying: `There's a dag for you ... do it if you can.'' 12. have or make a dag at `have a shot at'; OED2 sb&sup5. esp.  doing dags, 1879. The earliest non-extant usage may have referred to an event, rather than a person, out of the ordinary, rather than vice-versa as the present evidence might suggest.

Quote: Dag. Dried dung hanging from the wool on the sheep's hind legs, under the tail. Cutting this offwith an old pair of shears is called dagging. The dried dags on a sheep make a dry, rattling noise as the sheep runs, hence the term `rattle your dags'.

Quote: Lange came back from Australia after the debacle of two MPs who had supported him in his drive last year for the leadership fulminating that in Australia `the dags did not wag the sheep' in the Labour Party.  The inescapable inference from that is that here the sheep is being wagged by the dags (a choice of phrase hardly likely to enthuse those accused of doing the wagging).

Quote: In the rural districts [of New Zealand] a formidable body of idiomatic uses is developing and a new language is being coined. This isno more true than it is of the `remote' back-country of Canterbury, where changing vocabulary is already a noticable geographical characteristic. The local idiom is naturally often linked with sheep, wool, and station practice. `Dag', for example, is a word used first to describe a tuft of wool fouled by excrement. The removal of dags from the hind-quarters of sheep is a seasonal operation usually called `crutching.' Used personally, `dag' was earlier a term of some approbation.  Its meaning has widened, however, and now signifies no more than `hard case', or `tough guy', or `card.'

The gate is controlled by the milker, who can bring in the next cows without having to leave those already being milked.

Quote: There [on 5 May 1915 in the front line] survivors were ordered to cross an exposed strip of ground, frosted with spring daisies, before [the Turk-held hill] Achi Baba - a place long to be cursed as `The daisy patch'. ... The daisies were soon less conspicuous than the blackening blood of dead and dying New Zealanders as more and more were urged across the open ground. ... After the daisy patch, demoralisation and anger was as rampant among New Zealand officers as among men.

Quote: As well as superstitions, the whalers of Tory Channel had a few time-honoured habits. One of these was known as `a-day-for-the-Queen'. Its main application seems to have been when a whaler had had a heavy day on the grog and had butterflies in his stomach and head the nextday in the form of a hangover. If, for example, a harpoon-gunner like Trevor Norton was to have`a-day-for-the-Queen', he would be on a kind of half-alert. After a solid day on the booze he might find a nice, quiet bunk on board the Perano mother ship  Tuatea, where he could nestle down rather than being on lookout duty up on the hill.

It is a phrase that is not known in England, where the words `daytime release' are used as a label to a process parallel, though not identical with, that now developing here. ... It became current in New Zealand during the hearings of the Commission of Inquiry into Apprenticeship and Related Matters, 1944, and has continued in use though the wording of the Apprentices' Act does not include it [but uses] `technical training during working hours.'

Purple berries lay fallen, rich as damsons but not as big, and good only for the fantails ...  <i>Ibid.</i>  xx But ours [sc. leaves of history], darker, might cry, `Where is Selwyn? Where is Rutherford? Where is Katherine, with weeds on her grave at Fontainebleau, when what she really wanted was the dark berry along our creeks? (Don't you remember?

Its pelvic fins are narrow, elongated processes, hence the name Oar-fish. The Deal-fish is much smaller, but of the same type, but we know very little of the habits of either of them.

Quote: In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both track and trail and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hardto follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between track and  trail. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through The Tramper,  I could not find deer trail used until 1944, but deer track occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime deer track still seems to be used far more than deer trail.

Quote: The second dilemma for the cook is trying to make dehydrated foods not taste like dehydrated foods. Meat substitutes should be avoided, but faced with packets of risottos, chow meins, peas, soups, curries and flavourings, you would surely think that something else would emerge that would not inevitably taste like `dehye'. But you would be wrong.

Quote: When the selection [of the N.Z. Company share of the Otago Block] had been made the Crowngrant was to be issued, and there was an understanding that if Colonel Wakefield desired stillmore land he was to have it. This was the origin of what was afterwards known as thedepasturage licences, under which settlers were authorised to run cattle and sheep in the adjoining districts. <i>Ibid.</i> 138-139 Under the original terms, land purchasers were entitled upon payment of an annual license fee of 10s. 6d. to depasture or run sheep and cattle upon such waste lands within the block as remained unappropriated. ... though Captain Cargill was then gazetted Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Otago block only, he received no definite instructions upon the subject of granting the runs. [139] The result was that he merely filed the applications for depasturage licenses as they were presented to him, whilst the applicants were left to pursue their further course as seemed best to them.

Pensions were put on the four corners of the card, or points between, and two people took the bank. Even money was paid on the corners and three to one in the middle. There would be several hundred pounds sometimes waiting on the half-roll of the dew nappy.

(The numbers however are very different400,000 NZers against 70m of Irish descent.) The Irish use may be recent too, perhaps as a result of Mary O'Regan(?) president of Ireland who made a major speech  (about 1990 I think) in which she said that Ireland should reach out to its emigrants. Coming out of the KWC, there has been formed KEA (Kiwi Expatriates Association) to harness our diaspora for New Zealand's benefit.

Quote: Dingy wool - in practice this kind of wool is described with a variety of names. In New Zealand the most common names are 'dingy' .. There [in Australia] the term 'dingy' is most often used to describe discolored wool in general. The following discussion is confined to wool bearing excessive amounts of sand, earth and dust and for simplicity it is called dingy wool. It is the rule rather than the exception to find very weak back wool in dingy fleeces.

The alternative name of the Rifle Brigade, the E.L.O. (the Earl of Liverpool's Own) had been quietly allowed to lapse.

[fn] The newspapers urging enlistment in 1915 declared that the later men, joining the forces with motives of reasoned patriotism, would be more praiseworthy than the `impetuous spirits' of the Main Body. Hence thesardonic nickname of `the Dinks' - dinkum soldiers - attached to the new brigade.

It's made me think back to the guys who were the Dirty Dirties in those teams and the jobs they did." Being  Dirty Dirty is a thankless job. During the week the unwanted players are used as cannon fodder for the team, running in defence at training and trying to simulate a game atmosphere without (of course) injuring the guys playing in their place. Closer to the match they have to disappear, to give the playing 22 a bit of space, then on game day they are used for everything from ferrying bags to picking up the dirty playing gear after the game.

Quote: Magistrates courts were renamed district courts and their presiding judges district court judges in 1981, but the term magistrate in New Zealand denoted stipendiary magistrates rather than justices of the peace, who were and are usually referred to simply as justices or JPs. (District court has itself a history.  Originally district courts were intermediate courts created in 1858; they were squeezed out between the Supreme Court (now the High Court) and the magistrates courts and were formally abolished in 1925.) The latest episode of this serial is the creation in 1998 of community magistrates to sit in district courts and exercise minor criminal jurisdiction.

Quote: There are two explanations for the term Dog Town. The first has its clue in the name of the town, Port Chalmers, which obviously had a lot of docks. As with the Isle of Dogs in London, there is a belief that in the old days the docks of Port Chalmers caused it to be referred to as Dock Town, and the word became corrupted. But there are also legends that.. there were always many seamen about, sometimes unemployed, and all of them were accompanied by their dogs. Most of these men lived in cottages in George Street which became known locally as Dog Town and the name spread to mean Port Chalmers in general. It's occasionally heard even today.

Quote: The dog-leg fence, found in North America only in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, reappeared in the Nova Scotian settlement at Waipu, and from there spread to some other bush settlements in the north. It was constructed by driving two crossing stakes into the ground, and in the notch of these placing a third rail which followed the direction of the fence ... It was claimed that it would keep out cattle, but the fence was never widely adopted probably because of its tendency to get out of repair easily.

Quote: The net also plays into the Tories' hands by facilitating the "dog-whistle" campaigning at which Michael Howard has become increasingly adept. Just as a dog-whistle is inaudible to humans but is heard by every canine within miles, Howard has been beaming messages at targeted groups-anti-abortion campaigners, and people hostile to immigrants, gypsies and asylum-seekers-which, if broadcast in the normal way, might repel the majority of voters.

Quote: The crown was called a bull, a cartwheel, a caser, five  bob, and most familiar of all a dollar, the latter dating from the time when the rate of exchange was four US dollars to the pound. The only instance recorded of Cockney rhyming slang term for a coin is Oxford scholar, the derivation from dollar being obvious. The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull, half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and  two-and-a-buck. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only  two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

Bush sickness is always found in the volcanic district on coarse rhyolitic pumice soils and `dopiness' on soils derived from fine volcanic dust or mud showers. A soil on which `dopiness' develops is a leached loam and is found on deteriorated lands, i.e., lands which originally were highly fertile due to the ashes from the `bush burn,' the land subsequently becoming gradually less productive ...

Quote: [A US writer] The little Dominion of New Zealand is the more or less happy land popularly known as `Down Under.' ... It is doubtful whether the origin of the term `Down Under' will ever be known. It first came into general use during the World War of 1914-18, when the New Zealanders who fought in the ill-starred Gallipoli campaign were referred to as `the men from Down Under', but that was not the start of it. This faraway land, it seems, was known as `Down Under' in some parts of England and Scotland before the birth of the present century. The first World War merely [put] the expression into wider usage. An Auckland artist, Mr Trevor Lloyd,made it the subject of one of his cartoons at the very beginning of that great upheaval, and at least one English war correspondent used the term when writing on Gallipoli. After the year 1918 the expression fell into disuse, but during the second World War it again became popular, and I think we must thank the Americans for its revival. ... In England it is also known as the Antipodes.

Quote: Draft: (i) To divide stock into classes, either in a yard or  (cattle) by cutting out (q.v.). In the old days sheep were hand drafted, i.e. lifted over a rail or manhandled through agate. (Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],p.135) About 1864 it was found possible to run sheep one at a time through a drafting race and move a single gate as they came, so drafting into two lots. See double gate. Cattle are usually now drafted in a stock-yard  (q.v.). See also shed. (G.P. W.) (ii) A number of stock sent for  sale, e.g. `The annual Stonyhurst draft of four-year-old ewes will be offered.' When the draft is actually offered it is usually spoken of as a line.

Quote: DRAFTING: The main feature of sheepyards is the drafting race. This race, perhaps eight feet in length, is only wide enough for sheep to pass through in single file; at the end of the race are two swinging gates which can be manipulated to turn the sheep into different yards, and so separate them into different `lines' or mobs.

Quote:  `I will conclude this part of the subject with a few words about stockyards. They are generally made of stout posts and rails; the corner posts ought to be much stronger than the rest, as they often have to bear the weight of a heavy bullock in branding and other operations. The yard is generally divided into three portions - viz., a large yard for the whole herd, a drafting yard, and a milking yard, at one end of which is placed the milking shed, cow bails, and calf house, the whole being so arranged that a calf can be let out to suck its mother on one side while she is being milked on the other.'

Quote: In spite of this warning I climbed down a steep bank to the cave, but found no bones, only a beautiful group of dragon-palms - a rare coincidence. The leaves of these Dracaenae - called by the Maoris tohi-palms - possess flexible fibres out of which the natives weave their waterproof rain-mats  (pureke).

Quote: [??=nikau] These trees, however, were not the true cabbage-palms, nor did they belong at all to the class of palms, ... They were properly speaking a new species of dragon-trees, with broad leaves (dracaena australis) of which the central shoot when quite tender, tastes something like an almond's kernel, with a little of the flavour of cabbage.

Quote: I here first saw the great Dracophyllum; it formed a small tree about six inches in diameter, and twenty feet high; it is one of the most curious plants in the world; the leaves grow in tufts at the ends of the branches, just as in the dragon tree (Dracaena), and are the same shape, but in this species they are elegantly reflexed, like the feathers of a soldier's plume; they are a foot long and an inch broad at the base.

Quote:  [The fibres of wood in a tree just about to fall] do not part all in one plane and `stringers' or `drawers' are drawn out of the barrel, sometimes several feet long. Sometimes men on contract, trying to save timber, place their saw-cut too low and some of the wood-fibres break off up in the barrel. These are `stringers' while they are breaking, and `slivers' or `drawers' when they are left upright in the sloven.

Quote: A `draw' was a serious defect, but was not due to any fault in the living tree. When a tree fell before it was quite severed, it sometimes, in the act of falling, wrenched or `drew' out a portion of the butt, leaving great jagged, fang-like splinters adhering to the stump. The damage was, of course, always to the heart wood ... [<i>Ibid.</i> 156 [Edward Thompson] ... very often, before the saw got within a foot or so of the front scarf, the tree would start to fall gradually, and the uncut timber between the saw and the front scarf would have to break, and seldom cleanly; the heart, being more brittle than the sap, would break here and there, several feet above where thesawcut would have been standing straight. As the tree fell, these pieces, still attached to the stump, would draw out of the tree, and being almost heart-wood constituted the chief defect we call `draws'.

Quote: The term driving generally referred to tunnelling in any direction but in some circumstances, where reefs were present, it meant tunnelling along the line of the reef or parallel to it. The term drifting was used more specifically for driving on a reef, while the term crosscutting referredto tunnelling across the reef up to an angle of say forty-five degrees; however it was common to talk of `driving a crosscut'.

If you are chopping up a `face' and there is a large tree behind you further up the face, you select that as the `key'. To save time ... you do not waste time by chopping down each tree individually, but just `scarf' and partly chop each tree. When all is ready and you have worked back to the key, you scarf it verycarefully. ... If everything goes according to plan it will `drive' the one below, which will in turn drive the next, and so on ...

Quote: A `drive' was in progress; as the men do the underscrubbing they note the large trees and their distance from each other. They scarf each one so that it will fall on the next. Then, after all the smaller timber has been brought down, they fell the first tree which falls on the second and so starts a whole sequence of crashes. The line need not be straight. More often, it zig-zags from right to left. Bushmen can do wonders by means of an ingenious drive.

Quote: Suppose a friend says to me, `You know that drongo who was on the chain with me at the works last summer? Just a little joker he was, remember? A real serious ankle-biter. Hailed from somewhere down the Wire Wrapper. A right useless bastard. Couldn't see the road to the dunny if it had red flags on it. Well, it seems that he's shacked up with some pluty Remmers sheila and she's about to drop her bundle.' ... A non-New Zealander will probably require a translation, ... My friend is communicating to me the information that a slow-witted, incompetent person of diminutive stature, who was reared in the Wairarapa district and worked for a time in the killing gang of an abattoir, is now cohabiting with a wealthy woman from the affluent Auckland suburb of Remuera. This woman is soon to give birth.

Quote: The `drummer,' starting from the man who carried a drum, became the man who carried a swag and (then or thereafter) the loaded man (as a commercial traveller loaded with samples). To `carry the load' is another synonym; and the essential point throughout the symbolry was evidently the load.  ... and a `drummer' is the man with the lowest tally - perhaps because he is likeliest to take and keep the track with his `load.' The general applications of these fresh significations may be doubted.

He was [87 years old.] Dr Dye was born in Driffield, Yorkshire, and educated at Bridlington School and Leeds University from which he graduated in 1925 as a Doctor of Science. He came to New Zealand in 1929 to be a lecturer at the newly-founded Massey Agricultural College. Shortly after his arrival Dr Dry discovered a ram lamb in a flock near Palmerston North which had an extremely hairy fleece due to an abundance of halo-hairs. Dr Dry's successful efforts to isolate the gene in Romney led to the development of the Drysdale. Dr Dry devoted nearly 40 years studying the genetic makeup of the fleece of the sheep and published many papers. He retired from Massey University in 1956 as Professor of Animal Genetics but continued his interest in the Drysdale till his death.

Quote: Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. [175] Here is Little Ring as played in Waitara, Taranaki, in 1899: A team would consist of six to eight boys [order of shooting determined] ... An oval ring was decribed in the earth by means of a stick, and each player would `dub in' one marble ... A line was drawn some six or eight feet away, as the firing line, and the first player sang out `Fire!' as he fired the first shot.]

Quote: While presenting a programme on Radio Sport recently, I asked listeners what a "dudapper" was... Eventually, one caller came up with the correct answer : a dudapper was once the term used to describe a delivery that bounced twice before reaching the batsman. Shortly after, an elderly gentleman rang in to say that when he was a youngster playing school cricket in England, a team-mate by the name of Nipper Dingle made a specialty of such a delivery. I distinctly remember," said the caller, " our master taking us for practices and saying, 'I've never seen a boy who could bowl a dudapper like you, Nipper Dingle.'"
