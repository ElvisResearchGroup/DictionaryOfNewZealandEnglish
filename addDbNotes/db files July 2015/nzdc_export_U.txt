ultimate
Homonym Number:
Word Class:noun
Sense Number:
Definition:ultimate (frisbee) is a non-contact sport played by two seven player teams. The disc may only be moved by passing as the thrower is not allowed to take any steps. Any time a pass is incomplete, intercepted, knocked-down, or contacts an out-of-bounds area, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate change of possession of the disc. A goal is scored when a player successfully passes the disc to a teammate in the endzone which that team is attacking.

A young cow [allowed to run wild] when first milked is generally `baled up', that is, her head is secured between upright posts so that she can raise or lower it, but cannot turn round to use her horns. ... A pint or less of milk is considered a satisfactory result of the first attempt to milk an `unbroken heifer'. When a cow has submitted to this process a few times without much struggling, she is considered to be `well broken in to milk'.

It deepens into a tiny hidden runnel; at last there is created a subterranean stream, or, in shepherd's phrase, an `under-runner'. Its course is at first unseen, then, as through process of time its channel is gouged out, and as the carpet of humus fibre gives way at irregular intervals, great rents and holes betray its presence. The bed continues to deepen, the carpet of turf falls in more and more, until finally the under-runner becomes an open rivulet.

Quote: The full official title is Electric Multiple Unit, often shortened to Multiple Unit, or to Electric Unit (the latter also obtains in general popular usage). The `unit' is actually a motor-coach with one or two trailer-coaches attached. Depending on traffic, gradients, etc. up to three of these `units' can be put together under one driver to form, say, a nine-car train.  The concept is well known in railways management and is practised overseas, both with electric and diesel units. But the word unit seems to have surfaced as the popular name only in New Zealand (cf. Londoners' use of  tube), and only for electric units, not, e.g., for multiple diesel railcars, or in Christchurch, for tram-cars when they were designed to run as units.  Units were introduced to the Wellington-Johnsonville line in 1938; then to the Wellington-Paekakariki line in 1946; and a few years later to the heavily-used Hutt Valley line. The word came into popular usage (e.g. `I'm off to catch the unit.') probably c1939-40.

Quote: You know about the Maori custom of `unveiling' of tombstones? If you don't, it's more or less like this: A year after the burial the grave stone is installed, and a monument being unveiled. There used to be two recognised times for this in the North, apparently bypassing the `year after' which is seemingly more the custom of recent decades, Easter and All Saints Day, both of which are distinct from the usual fixed times for clearing the burial grounds (which were usually just before Christmas or, in some places, the first Saturday in March). In very recent years around, for instance, the Hokianga, interest and care for the burial grounds has markedly increased. Along  with that has come another change, in giving notice publicly. I enclose one long clipping from the Whangarei Northern  Advocate of a kind I doubt is at all common, but the NZ Herald supervisor of memorial notices tells me that to her knowledge notices of the kind have been appearing for ten years or so, but (she thinks) are now more frequent. So, for a start, we have a sense of unveiling in NZ which is likely to be peculiar as `We went up North for an unveiling (of a headstone for one or more people)'. That sense has been around for some time. What seems to be new or newish is the sense of the other clipping, `So and so was unveiled on such and such a day'. I checked with Roger Oppenheim whose book on Maori Death Customs you may know, and Roger regards this as new to him (and he has Maori kin and attends Maori gatherings of the kind). Where `Mr Te Hona's unveiling was on Saturday' doesn't strike him (or me, for that matter) as anything out of the way, `Mr Te Hona was unveiled on Saturday' registers as odd, but didn't seem odd to the Herald supervisor.

My only suggestion is that the eucalypts exude some kind of adhesive substance, or resin, or gum, but that is a pastime indulged in by many other kinds of trees, anyway. But one thing is certain; the word gum, as nailed on to these trees, has nothing to do with what you are asked to take your change in ....

Quote: [preface] Some explanation of the title, which, to persons living outside Maoriland, may appear as incomprehensible as it is odd, is perhaps called for ... Most born New Zealanders, whether fair or dark, have some conception of the meaning of the word UTU, albeit, to pakeha ears it toofrequently conveys nothing more than a hazy idea of money compensation. ...  Practically, utu meant payment. The ancient Maori did nothing for nothing ...  No man could accept service or gifts without requital and retain the esteem of his fellows; still less could he allow injuries to pass unavenged. Utu (value) he expected for the presents he made; utu (payment) he required for goods or produce; utu (satisfaction) he exacted from hereditary foes and all whom he conceived [?had] injured him. A vendor [?in] the early days of settlement, would request UTU for his produce; a settler desiring to purchase would enquire in his pidgin Maori, `How muchee te utu?' From this milder meaning, expressive of compensation and commodities exchanged, comes the pakeha use of the word signifying money. In settler's parlance `Kahore ti [?] utu' means `I have no money', for to their ears utu is synonymous with `tin', `sugar', and other slang terms used to denote our medium of exchange.
