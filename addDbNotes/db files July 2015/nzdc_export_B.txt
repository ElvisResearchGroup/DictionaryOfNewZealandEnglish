Already sold in Japan as "baby kiwifruit" since 1995, it has been targeted by Hortresearch breeders who want to carry the thin skin, high sugar content and flavour over into new cultivars.

Quote:  The bach, these days, tends to be the name given to any smallish holiday house by the beach, no matter how sophisticated. But, in the past, it meant a small home, built by the owner - away out on the edge - by sea or river. Usually it was occupied for just a few summer weeks each year... The great building boom for the archetypal bach was after World War I, with another boom of more gentrified, less interesting baches after World War II.

Each has a water tank, various structures to hold firewood and fishing gear, some have a boat shed or a TV aerial and each has a chimney or flue of some kind.

Quote:  'A good deal was said in Court on Tuesday during the hearing of a case about threshing-machines, and no little amusement was caused by a list given by one witness of the 'technical' names of titles of some of the workmen employed about them.  'Chaffy' and 'baggy' raised a smile merely, but 'straw walloper' tickled everybody except the witness, who glanced around with an air of pity on the laughing faces of those who were ignorant of the designation of the man who attends to the straw elevator.  Some machines, it appears, boast of two 'straw wallopers', others are content with one'.

Journalists reporting on the National Party leadership scuffle swooped on the oddly Kiwi word "bagmen" to refer to the candidates' chief lobbyists in caucus... Elsewhere a bagman can be lot of things, all pretty well removed from getting in the vote for Bill or Don. In Oz it's an alternative to swagman.  Elsewhere, it is a commercial traveller. Elsewhere again, and more sinisterly, it is one who collects racketeers' money. In a list of Post Office workers, it appears with porters. The <i>New Oxford Dictionary of New Zealand English</i> reckons it's a man who helps fill sacks of grain. The nearest to our special meaning is a Canadian reference to "political fundraiser".

Quote:  Now this is where I made a big mistake. Mine were holding dogs and, when asking Tony whether his dogs would help I was thinking along the lines of holding something like an ear, a leg, or a snout. Tony, however, had only bailing dogs with him; his catching dog, Rock, was tied up at the cowshed and in saying, "Oh sure", he was meaning his dogs would dive down and keep the mob bailed up.

Quote:   In this land two infections assail all comers and vie with one another for first place. These are known as Malaria and Balkan Tap respectively. On the first we need not dwell, but a little information about the latter may be of interest. A similar infection has been met with elsewhere, and in Gyppo Land is known as `magnune', whilst away in our own sunny island I think `dippy' about covered it. Here we have a more or less insidious form of the disease, and no one with six months' residence to his credit may hope to escape. There are two varieties of the disease, malignant and benign. In the latter form the symptoms are easily recognised, and are amenable to treatment; but with the malignant type the victims, quite unconscious of infection, blindly affirm their condition to be normal, This form of the malady has several unfortunate features and is incurable. The percentage in our unit is very high.

Quote:  Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.

Quote:  <i>bank and bank</i>. A river runs bank and bank when all the streams join into one; i.e., when in high flood (Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement], p. 73). Hence a banker. The expressions were probably introduced by the shagroons. [Morris Austral English] gives a banker as meaning a river full to the top of its banks. New Zealand rivers, of course, do not get as full as that.

Quote:  I take a good deal more notice of the Bank of New Zealand than I do of the other banking institutions. It is for the reasons that it is our own national establishment, and every man, woman, and child, is interested in its welfare and affected by its management. Virtually, it belongs to the public; the shareholders, nominally the proprietors, are merely trustees. My view may be extreme on this point but I believe the day is not far distant when the people of New Zealand will take possession of that bank in their own name, and tax all the others out of the country - a protection policy that would pay well.

These ribs or dyke-like masses are the `hard bars' of the miners. In some cases, however, these `hard bars' are probably due to dykes. <i>Ibid.</I> 111The `hard bars' of mining terminology are in most cases merely remnants of less-altered rock, but occasionally as in the case of the `bar' mentioned in the Golden Pah mine, they owe their existence to intrusives.

Truly, this pubbery was just short of shanty, typical of the `Outer Barcoo', but where Maories, their Wahines, or broken down `Remittancers' could drown their sorrows, wander into the `arms of Bacchus' or chase pink elephants.

Notes: Barrack v and n, and derivatives are borrowed from Australian  usage; barracker n, a supporter of a sports team is the earliest  recorded NZ use ; with barracking vbl n `chaffing' also early. The verb is recorded from early in the 20 century mainly from Truth. -->The two senses probably have separate derivations: v1 `to support', `cheer for', from N.Irish (EDD) barrack, `to brag, be boastful of one's fighting powers': the example given from Antrim: ` `One boy will say of another `He's only barracking'. v2 `to chaff; attack with words' from an Aboriginal negative  barak; in Australia and New Zealand often found as borak, and  anglicised and folk-formed to borax (cf POKE BORAX). -->but cf the curious usage: -->1668(?) Dryden `A Defence of an Essay of Dr. P.' ed D. Nicol Smith 133 ... and that in some authors reserare was to shut as well  as to open, as the word barack, say the learned, is both to bless and curse.

A cadet of the early 1880s, Mike, describes a "lesser barrelling", which involved being tied to a bed, taken outside and leaned up against a wall. Shaving cream, toothpaste, nugget and even excrement were rubbed on the victim who was then hosed off.

The term <i>hophead</i> is (or was) used in convivial greetings, `Hello, hophead', the implication that the person addressed was a persistent drinker being equivalent to calling him a decent joker.

Many experienced farmers are firmly of the opinion that slagged pastures have better milk production and fattening capacities than ones treated with superphosphate. How much this may be due to a greater effect from slag, how much to some effect on the mineral content of the herbage, and how much due to management it is impossible to say.

Its miraculous and sudden appearance caused the ancient Maori to term it `thunder dirt'.

Quote:  (Joe Gasparich, Northland kauri country), The way in which the bush people - the bushmen and their wives -

stuck to one another is shown by the way they rallied round in the case of a family that was in need. A common method of raising money was called a `basket social'. A hall would be used for the function, and the

people of the district would be invited to bring along baskets. Now these baskets were made of any material

at all at hand, and it was remarkable the ingenuity and workmanship shown in making them. ... In the basket its maker put a supper, the food cooked at home ... [151] Now on the night of the basket social, all the baskets

would be handed in ... They would then be auctioned, and the purchaser of the basket would have the pleasure

and the honour of having supper with the provider of the basket. ... Now I've seen them pay twelve ... pounds in those days for a basket, just to make sure that the girl of the boy's choice saw that he really meant business. ... Every penny of that would go to the family in need ...

Quote:  Basket socials were always a stir [in Northland c1920s]. ... Basket socials were the nearest we got to bacchanalia - tipsy cake in large doses could have strangely affecting results. The baskets were put up for auction just before the supper waltz; highest bidder got basket and girl - the girl, sometimes it turned out, for life.

Quote:  And then the mill workers organized a big basket social for us, and with the money they arranged a grand picnic. <i>Ibid.</i> 153 [pre WW1, Northland bush], A basket social took the form of a dance, with an auction of supper baskets. Each girl would make a pretty basket and fill it with good things for supper. When supper-time came, the baskets were auctioned from the stage and keen was the rivalry and competition for some of the baskets, young blades emptying their pockets and often dipping into their bank accounts in trying to out-bid their rivals.

Quote:  <i>battle</i> make pregnant, merely make love. Vince Boyle of Winton was researching a history of Mossburn when he came across a fellow recalling his wagoning days in 1914 in Northern Southland, and spoke of how he `battled a woman'. He was going to marry her, but a few days before the wedding she had a dentist remove her teeth and sent him the bill. They did not get married. Farmer and Henley describe a battler as one given up to debauchery, which leaves an outside chance that the wagoner merely seduced and failed to fertilise.

We ... [51] could not afford to take such a weighty camp. We therefore pitch an ordinary 6 ft. by 8 ft. canvas tent, on a ridge pole, with an 8 ft. by 10 ft. fly six inches above it; and cut the tent in half along the ridge, and taking away one half, leave the other half standing. This is just large enough to allow two men to lie `heads and tails'. [The side left open, and one side of fly raised 4 ft. in middle, and under this the fire burns so have shelter in wet weather.]

It is a term one hears often (in fact I devoted a section to the `bay villa' in an architectural thesis I recently completed). The `bay' refers to the bay window (naturally enough); and also, some say, to San Francisco Bay. It was (and is) a house form common in that city; and it may well have spread to New Zealand from there.

The latter were on the gravelly river banks which the miners sluiced away bodily for the golden grains ... The former were on the sandy margins of the river, and were often extended by means of `wing-dams' and other ingenious devices far into the rushing waters. In these claims the gold was found lodged in `pockets' or fissures formed by the slate bars ...

Quote:   Collet's quicksilver plates rapidly became common on the beach-claims although they did not completely supplant the simpler cradle and sluice-box. <I>Ibid.</I> 244 It was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.

These black layers are often one or two inches thick, and repose upon coarse quartzose sands. As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.

Quote:  At each place which I have visited, I have been assured that the Maories are dying rapidly - `perishing like rotten sheep,' these people often say; thus at Kurreroo or Molineux, where there are now half-a-dozen natives, they say that formerly, and at no remote period, about two generations previous to the present, there were above a thousand; and in many other places within the last sixteen years, which is about the extent of the experience of the older beachers, there has been, in many places, a corresponding diminution of numbers. If this is an unexaggerated statement, it is a very distressing one to reflect on. Since Dr. -- visited this settlement, one of the residents, Mr. --, an educated man, has opened a school for half-bred or any other children, and the progress which the children have already made is very encouraging.

Quote:  Incoming skins are sorted to arbitrary standards - wigs (old males), clap-matches (females), bulls, yearlings, grey or silver pups (under one year), black pups. If the cargo is intended for the European or American market, the skins are removed from the animal with an inch of blubber adhering, and in the final simple treatment are washed, heavily slated, and then folded or `booked' into rectangular shape for packing. Skins destined for China, however, are treated with more preliminary care. They are taken as cleanly as possible, and after careful washing are sent to the `beamer' to be thoroughly scraped free of the last remaining particles of flesh and blubber.

Quote:  Boy was certainly the fastest sheep dog I have ever seen. He put in a splendid hunt, which would have been a bad head if the sheep had not been so fast, and hunted them all on to the next man's beat. <i>Ibid.</i> 18 I was two beats from the top, and there was shingle all the way. It slid continuously, and all the time I had to bear up hill, to keep a level track. However, we got off `the hill' quite early, put the sheep across Cat Creek at Tarndale, and raced for the homestead.

But the cass, like most New Zealand rivers, is continually liable to flood ... In this paper the term `river-bed', following the colloquial usage, is used to include that part of the valley liable to be covered with water in times of severe floods. This `river-bed' is bounded on either side by a broad expanse of flat land, chiefly tussock-covered, termed colloquially `river-flat', but in this paper `terrace'.

Quote:  With the view of obviating the confusion caused by the misuse of the common names hitherto applied to the New Zealand beeches, I would suggest the adoption of new names based on the obvious characteristics of their foliage:- For <i>Fagus fusca</i>, tooth-leaved beech; for <i>Fagus solandri,</i> entire-leaved beech; and for <i>Fagus menziesii,</i> round-leaved beech.

Blairii, F. Menziesii, F. fusca, F.

Quote:  <i>Birch</i>. Various species of Nothofagus. There are various kinds (white, red, black etc.) of trees in New Zealand called birches. They are all really beeches and the newspapers and forestry people are trying to get them so called, but up country they are still always called birches. Birch (creeks, hill, etc.) is one of the commonest components of local names in the South Island. ([1898 Morris Austral-English], and an unpublished letter to Hunter Brown from Dr Hodkinson, August 9, 1854.)

Quote:  Five species of <i>Nothofagus</i> were formerly recognised in New Zealand, but more recently two of these have been combined as varieties of one species. <i>Nothofagus menziesii</i>: silver beech (the bark is white and silvery particularly in young trees). <i>Nothofagus fusca:</i> red beech (the timber is reddish in colour). <i>Nothofagus truncata:</i> hard beech (the wood has a high silica content making it hard). <i>Nothofagus solandri</i> var. <i>solandri</i>: black beech (the bark is very dark partly due to the growth of a sooty mould). <i>Nothofagus solandri </i>var. <i>cliffortioides</i>: mountain beech (grows mainly at higher altitudes than other beeches).

Quote:  When the flax arrives at the mill it is weighed and credited to the cutter. The `bench loader' then takes two or three bundles and puts them in a barrel (heavy end down). He then takes the longest leaves and places them on a bench convenient to the `feeder'. ...[44] The `feeder' takes each blade separately and places the butt end into the `stripper' which takes the green outer covering off. ... The fibre as it leaves the stripper is caught by the `fly boy', who collects enough to make into a hank, which he places convenient for the `shaker'. The latter, with a motion like cracking a whip, gets rid of as much rubbish as possible, after which he places the hank handy for the `washer'. This man places the fibre in a vat, through which ... clean water is running.

Quote:  The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

The iron block stays still, grinding the ore into a slime. Water flows into the dish and spills over the edge carrying the lighter gold-free particles and slurry with it. Then mercury is added to absorb or amalgamate the gold and silver. It's usually used for testing the ore.

There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

Quote:  With small slips they are either mixed with the pieces or sent to store to be binned. <i>Ibid.</I> 711-712 In `Binning,' the bales are broken up and classed into lines. This method of building up saleable lines is generally used in the case of small parcels of fleece wool and bales of oddments which cannot be included in the main lines without destroying their evenness. As each vendor's wool [712] is classed in the binning-room, the wool in each class is weighed and credited to the owner before being placed in its appropriate bin.

Quote:  Wool may be opened and reclassed in the broker's store, repacked [67] in the owner's bales, and sold under his `brand'; or it may be opened, classed, and then `binned'. Binning is a system of pooling similar wools from a number of properties, allowing the smaller quantities to be grouped for sale. The farmer is credited according to the weight of his wool that has been assigned to each bin. This wool is sold under the broker's brand.

Also occas. used for species of other general thought to resemble Nothofagus. occas. (usu. overseas usage) New Zealand birch.

As with beech, vernacular naming tries to distinguish var. and spp. by ref. to colour of bark, texture of wood or timber, appearance of leaf, etc., but with similar confusion and local variation.

Quote:   On the Hollyford job the road went through beech-forest, but this was locally called birch. Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti</i>, and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch.

They are all really beeches and the newspapers and forestry people are trying to get them so called, but up country they are still always called birches. Birch (creeks, hill, etc.) is one of the commonest components of local names in the South Island.

In the Wellington and Marlborough districts it is called `black-birch'; in Canterbury it is called `black-birch,' `white-birch,' `red-birch,' and `brown-birch'; in Otago it is known as `white-birch,' `black-birch,' or black-heart birch.' Young specimens of this tree that have no dark heart-wood are often called `white-birch.' This tree is a beech, and it would do away with confusion if it was called `black-beech'. <i>Fagus Menziesii. </i>- The commonest name of this tree is `silver-birch,' but it is often called `brown-birch,' `red-birch,' and `white-birch' [308] in different localities. It would be best to call it `silver-beech,'though it is gaining an Australasian reputation as `Southland beech.' <i>Fagus fusca. </i>- In Auckland this tree is called `black-birch'; in Wellington `red-birch'; in Nelson, Marlborough and Westland it is called `brown-birch'; and in Otago it is called both
`red-birch' and `bull-birch.' The most suitable name is `red-beech.'

Quote:   '... the term birch may be regarded as a generic name applied by bushmen to any small-leaved tree, and qualified by the prefixes `black', `white' or `red' at the caprice of the individual or as may be suggested by the colour of its foliage, bark or timber.' So the term `black birch' was in many districts applied to Pittosporum tenuifolium [ ] and to Weinmannia racemosa [Kamahi] in Otago - the latter tree being also known as `brown birch' or `red birch.' Myrsine Urvillei [ ] was known as `red birch', and Carpodetus serratus [ ] and Quintinia serrata [ ] as `white birch.' It was principally to the trees of the species Nothofagus (then known a Fagus), that the term `birch' was applied, and a distinguishing of the various kinds by the prefixing of a descriptive word was a step in the right direction; but in this instance the step was on a path that led to a quagmire. To take only the instance of N. Solandri (formerly Fagus Solandri). [v. 1885 Kirk] ... The confusion created has been endless ; it
has at times even resulted in commercial loss ; [v. (Morris) 1889 Kirk `Forest Flora of NZ p.91] yet so strong is habit that confusion was preferred before a change of name. And, indeed, the bushmen might well ask what name they should adopt ; for the scientists came and added to the confusion by pointing out that the trees usually called `birch' were not birch at all, but `beech' - when a fresh crop of names resulted.: `black beech', `red beech', `dusky beech', etc. The scientists themselves, however, in calling the species Nothofagus, `beech', took care - that is, usually took care - to make the distinguishing prefix one that would not lead to a repetition of the old confusion. N. Solanderi was accordingly called `entire-leaved beech' ; N. Cliffortioides, `mountain beech' ; N. Menziesii, `round-leaved beech' ; N. fusca `tooth-leaved beech'. It was some time before even these names were agreed upon ; and `silver beech' finally took the place of `round-leaved beech' for N. Menziesii. A note may here be made
of the fact that, whilst the entire-leaved beech was Fagus Solandri, on Fagus being changed to Nothofagus, Solandri was altered to Solanderi ; but this has been altered back again to Solandri ; for that was the original and not incorrect spelling of the word.

Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green.

Quote:  On the Hollyford job the road went through beech-forest, but this was locally called birch. Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti,</i> and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused
by beech trees.

Quote:  as common in NZ in a variety of senses and uses as it is in gen. Eng. - esp. bit of a, pronounced [ ] and often spelt <I>bituva</I>, used adjectively for `small, little', and also ironically in understatement as `large' (e.g. 1944 `I must 'er made a bituva mistake, and opened up yer nose'): also used (esp. by children) adverbially as `rather': e.g. `It's bituva hot in here'. These and other uses are attested in OED(S) and EDD; cf hang of a; collocations (A) BIT OF (A) [to go to file 3BI5 BIT 1.]. The expression is in constant use. It has different meanings, but each is clear from the circumstances of the conversation. For example:

<I>A bit of luck, A bit of a break</I> The event is praised, its quality is genuine.

<I>A bit of a lark, A bit of fun</I>  There is no intense quality in the event.

<I>A bit of an ass, aren't you?</I>  The quality of the topic is weakened so that the remark will not sting as much.

<I>A bit of a hold-up (i.e. check to progress)</I>  The delay is brief.

<I>A bit of risk attached to it</I>  The proportion of risk is not great, possibly slight.

<I>A bit of a muddler, A bit of a no-hoper, A bit of a poor show </I> The quality referred to is present in full force.

I was curled in a ball and my knees, which were crammed against the walls of the sleeping bag, were even more numb than my nose.

It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occured in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood.

Quote:  June 26 [1958]. Minister of Finance Arnold Nordmeyer presented his first Budget, increasing taxes on beer, spirits, cigarettes and tobacco. Known ever after as the Black Budget, it was a response to a balance of payments crisis and introduced cheap housing loans and the Pay-As-You-Earn (Paye) tax system.

Nordmeyer's budget [of June 1958] was remembered as `the black budget' for many years. It can be argued that it was good for `the country'. For the government it was a suicidal mistake. It was the biggest blunder in Nash's political career. Although he was not immediately and directly responsible, he was the leader and did not say `No'.

Quote:  Better or not the officially sanctioned substitute was announced early in August and the Gal Blacks of brief notoriety (along with other canvassed names such as Elle Blacks and She Bs

- after ABs) were finally history. The team was henceforth to be known as the Black Ferns. Here the colour adjective fittingly remains, and the noun echoes the name sported (since the early 1990s) by another black-clad international New Zealand women's team, the netballers or Silver Ferns. Since that title itself derives from the famous fernleaf-cum-national symbol of the All Black jersey (to wear the silver fern is a common variant of to be an All Black), there is an obvious appropriateness in reapplying the fern to the rugby union context. Black Ferns is further legitimised bv the presence in the natural world of a black (tree-) fern, in Maori the mamaku.

It is known to fishermen and those in the fishing industry as the River Flounder as it is caught mostly inside or near the mouths of rivers and enters lakes where it lives chiefly among weeds. To some it is known as the Maori Flounder.

Quote:  Generally the greater portion of the sand is removed, but in favourable spots, sheltered either by a slight indentation in the coast-line, or by some large pieces of drifted timber, its heavier particles remain; these consist [529] of black iron-sand (both magnetic and titaniferous oxide of iron) associated with small garnets and with gold. These black layers are often one or two inches thick, and repose upon coarse quartzose sands. As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.

This is the easiest way of getting gold, so easy it is called `haymaking', but it will not last long, as the black sand brought down by the rivers, with its gold from the mountains and cast up on the beach where it has lain for centuries, is of limited extent.

Quote:  The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.

"Unfortunately, they lost exclusive rights to their name when a judge ruled that Blackwater rafting had become a generic name for cave tubing and others in the industry could use it... For example, Blackwater Rafting was involved in cave tubing, but the media continued to describe the activity as blackwater rafting. The company should have corrected this the first time, as by not doing so the term eventually became generic."

These blanketings I found have ... a decidedly acid reaction, due ... to the presence of ferric and ferrous salts ..., and it is to the former ... that what is commonly known as [335] `flouring,' is mainly due, in the process cited above; such ferric salts being able to either oxidize or chloridize the surface of any mercury ..., thus enfilming it with a compound, which being practically insoluble in water ... prevents that metallic contact taking place between detached mercurial globules, which is necessary to amalgamation.

These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

Practical sheep men found that this complaint produced `staggers'. Too much blood obtained, although the patient was in splendid condition, used to keep spinning round, and the remedy was the ancient panacea of most diseases in England, centuries ago, and ere science interrupted their outlook, viz. `to bleed' and take from the patient the overflow of red corpuscles.

Quote:  According to the afficionados of New Zealand's musical history, Blerta stands for Bruno Lawrence's Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition.  For most New Zealanders over 50, however, Blerta is best remembered as a colourful troupe of artists, anarchists and musicians who travelled the highways and byways of New Zealand in a vivdly decorated omnibus of indeterminate age and intermittent reliability. ... Religious allusions aside, Blerta's over-riding message was fun.

Quote:  During its five-year run in the 1970s, Blerta attracted such an extraordinary collection of movers, shakers and far-out characters, Bruno was just one wild man among many... "It's possible to trace the beginings of the New Zealand film industry from Blerta," says Murphy, whose documentary <i>Blerta Revisited</i>, features in the naton's film festivbals this month... Blerta began in October, 1971, when Bruno was 30 years old and restless as a bear stung by a swarm of bees... Blerta was an acronym for Bruno Lawrence's Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition... "Blurter" was also a rude term for genitals in '70s slang.

The prospector is anchored by a rope which is controlled by a mate on the bank. He wheels a wheelbarrow as far into the torrent as is possible, shovels the alluvial wash into it blindly, because the water contains glacial silts and is milky white, and returns to the bank with as much as he can shift. This is processed at leisure for gold

Quote:  A few years ago I travelled to Britain via Australia and on the boat an Englishman was telling me that while in Australia he bought a block of land and built his own house. To me the word block suggested a large piece of land, so with visions of Sid Kidman I asked him how big. He replied, `Oh, just fifth of an acre,' I said that in NZ we would call that a section. An American put in that in his country a section was a square mile and the word was used with that meaning in parts of Australia, but in the States they used the word `lot' to describe a building block. I replied that in NZ building blocks were the piles that a house stood on and the Englishman said that in Australia they called them stumps.

Quote:  Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies. <i>Ibid.</I> 176 [Waitara, Taranaki, 1899] A `taw' was usually an `alley' or `blood alley' made of agate. We used to take them home and burn
them in a fire to convert them into `blood alleys'.

Quote:  Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, [sic] chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie.

Quote:  The larger species [of <i>Aciphylla</i>] are familiar to the settlers as `Spear-grass', or `Bayonette-grass', `Wild' or `Bloody-Spaniard', [<i>bloody</i> =?] in allusion to their very rigid, strong, poniard-like, sharp-pointed leaves ... Hence a `Spear-grass Scrub' on the hill ranges is frequently most formidable ... to men and horses, though it forms one of the favourite hunting grounds of the Wild Pig. In the Matukituki Valley, `Bayonette-grass' forms an undergrowth in a dense scrub of prickly thorn ... [50] Familiar to the shepherds of Canterbury as `Bloody Spaniard'.

Quote:  Dan Freel's conversation [as an Irish settler] was plentifully interlarded with oaths and obscurities that are - or would have been in the [18]80's - quite unprintable. At first it seemed an arresting, if not an interesting idiosyncracy, but one sickened of it. ... The sanguinary adjective too that sounds so daring but really has no significance whatever, he used between every second word, even between syllables as `I bloody well told the bloody mongrel that he was too ego-bloody-istical.' After the first few sentences this gave no gain in force and much loss in time. I noticed that the Irishmen, though they obviously bowed to Dan's smallest word, did not give him the sincerest flattery of imitation in this respect.

Quote:  The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

Quote:  The Bludger. He was known among the boobheads as that. When they called him by his name you felt they were being intentionally respectful. ... But connected with him it didn't mean what it was supposed to mean. A bludger is a pimp, a man who lives on women, but I doubt if anyone thought specifically that of him. Bludger is also what it sounds, a fairly indiscriminate term of abuse. When the boobheads called him that they meant a lot of things. A bully, something sly, a chap who'd put a dirty one on to you, not necessarily for any purpose other than it gave him pleasure to do so.

When the Pakeha mentions the matuku he always refers to the bittern; the other he always calls blue-heron. </i>

Besides it carries the blue moon on its wings, and it is like other blue moons - it is there all the time, but it is only when you are in certain positions that you see it.' The name has stuck and is certainly appropriate. The butterfly is known as the `common eggfly' in Australia.

Quote:  It's a story of the vision of New Zealander Roger Beattie who, in 1989, established the                 first ocean based blue pearl farm at Whangamoe Inlet on New Zealand's Chatham Islands...

Although most of the nucleation process is kept a secret, the Eyris Blue Pearl Company are continuing to refine the art of attaching a seed to the  inside of the shell, beneath the mantle, so that a blue pearl mabe can develop... Once the seed is inserted beneath the mantle, the paua begins to overlay this nucleus with its brilliant mother-of-pearl, made up of layer upon layer of conchiolin and nacre.

So armed with all this, some bright spark in Australia has decided to call it Blue Stuff - not HorsePower or Super Horse, or even methoxyxchlororidepanoprophren.You can imagine the confusion when there's a pre-dawn bang on the door and the coppers are yelling through the letterbox: "We're looking for illegal Blue Stuff."

New Zealand blue vein is recognised as a blue cheese in its own right and can be distinguished from its Continental counterparts by the deeper yellow colour of its curd. This arises from a difference in milk colour.

I am quite unable to suggest what fish is meant by `blue-fish,' unless, indeed, the observer has used the names indiscriminately. These fish were very numerous, were taken during every month of the year, and fed chiefly on mussel, but occasionally on small fish. They weighed from 1lb to 2lb each.

Quote:  The custom of tattooing is now falling out of fashion amongst the rising generation of both sexes, and it is to be hoped that before many years have passed, the nickname of `Blue-lips' will no longer be applicable to the native girls of New Zealand. Where the tattooing is confined to the slender lyre-shaped line on the fair one's chin, the effect is really not unpleasing; but the tattooed lip is an abomination.

Quote:  Calves not kept for the herd become <i>bobby calves</i>, a truly standard word since it was defined in the <i>Bobby Calf Marketing Regulations</i> in the New Zealand Statutory Regulations, 1938: `Bobby calf' means a calf which is intended for slaughter for human consumption as boneless veal.' The origin and dating of the word are doubtful. There is a similar word poddy calf for a hand-fed calf, recorded in Australia from last century. The present New Zealand meaning seems to have arisen about 1929. The Christchurch Times, 17 August 1929, reported: `During the last year or so quite a trade has grown up in young, or `bobby' calves, which are taken in by the freezing works, killed and exported.' The term <i>vealer</i> is also used.

Quote:  Prior to the season 1927-28, it was customary to kill all surplus calves on the farm, and dispose of their skins only. The trade, which is known locally as `The Bobby Calf' trade, developed during that season, and has extended rapidly each year since. Under this system of disposal, calves are collected by motor lorry and delivered at freezing-works, where they are slaughtered and packed as boneless veal.

Quote:  By definition a boddler is a smallish person who is not really a baby but not quite a full-blown toddler. The expression, boddler boy, was copied after a mother from Waimahaka, in Southland, was savagely attacked by her 14-month-old son with a sawn-off rattle.

peculiar to the middle 20th Century, but

the characteristics are not... In the

under-privileged masses the counterparts

of Bodgies were variously styled as

'yahoos', 'larrikins', 'hooligans' and

'yobs'. The 'playboy' of upper class

society is the "Bodgie" of the poor.

Quote:  A stereotypical bogan or "westie" is a male clad in black jeans and black T-shirt embellished with the name of a heavy metal band. Females of this genus are normally found wearing ill-fitting jeans and lace blouses or velvet dresses and an optional speckled leather jacket.  The bogan car of choice is Holden and the more grunt the better. Fluffy dice are mandatory and not optional. The bogan drink of choice is Lion Red and preferably from a crate. Bogan pastimes usually involve their car and ranged from drag racing down residential streets to peel-out sessions in vacant lots.

I think bogans are something we all identify with - they are part of our national identity and we should appreciate them."... Packer's fringed leather cuffs anbd collars are inspired by bogan chicks' tasselled boots. Her line of T-shirts feature popular bogan names like Shazza, Mussa, Gazza and Bazza as well as bogan vehicles like Holdens, Cortinas and Toranas.

Quote:   `Boiling-down' was formerly practised to a considerable extent in Australia; the mere fat or tallow of the animal for export to England <i>being worth far more than the meat for colonial consumption</i>. `Boiling-down establishments' were formed in the pastoral districts, and the process became a regular business. The sheep or cattle were killed and skinned, the carcass thrown into the boiling vat, the fat skimmed off for export tallow, and the meat thrown away. `Boiling down' will probably remain a permanent feature of Australian grazing in the districts remote from large towns.

Notes:	J Boon (jboon@unitec.ac.nz) suggests this comes from the phrase "bolt from the blue". Trish Ryan (dentrish@clear.net.nz) says it comes from "infamous horse betting circles. Back before the days of judicial videos, race results were sometimes 'pre-arranged'. The backed horse would be given the perfect run in behind a nominated pacemaker. Other horses would be ridden into deadend passages or taken wide in the run home. Occasionally an uncooperative pacemaking horse would 'bolt' on its jockey and win the race - and lose large betting plunges that had been made on the intended victor." >Google search showed in used in Australia also and to a lesser degree also UK, the Netherlands

There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.

Quote:  An effective treatment that uses no herbicide has been found to control the coastal pest plant boneseed, says the Wellington Regional Council. Boneseed is flowering now, the best time for control... Boneseed is widely established throughout the coastal areas of the Wellington region, especially Wellington's south coast, Eastbourne, Pukerua Bay and Raumati... Boneseed produces clusters of small, yellow daisy flowers that cover the plant in late winter to early summer. The single-seed is very hard and bone-like in colour and texture when ripe (thus the name boneseed. Boneseed is a bushy shrub which grows to 2-3 metres high producing up to 50,000 seeds per plant. From South Africa, it was introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant and is now found throughout the North Island, mostly in coastal situations, and in the South Island.

The bong comprises a plastic funnel joined at the base by a long plastic tube, it can be large or small. It can hold from one to four bottles of beer. One person holds the contraption high in the air while the intended recipient puts the end of the tube in his mouth and allows the beer to rush in a torrent into his stomach. ... Four bottles is said to test the digestive system to the limit and is almost impossible to keep down and so usually leads to what is called a `power chunder' or projectile vomiting.

There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.

Club 574 is a Boob - it contracts 45 sex workers. As for the Soobs, which are typically 2 or 3 women whoring out of private homes throughout the Auckland suburbs, the city council argues they could move into the city, where there are 9500 apartment units or, more to the point, 12,000 bedrooms.

Quote:  Incoming skins are sorted to arbitrary standards - wigs (old males), clap-matches (females), bulls, yearlings, grey or silver pups (under one year), black pups. If the cargo is intended for the European or American market, the skins are removed from the animal with an inch of blubber adhering, and in the final simple treatment are washed, heavily slated, and then folded or `booked' into rectangular shape for packing. Skins destined for China, however, are treated with more preliminary care. They are taken as cleanly as possible, and after careful washing are sent to the `beamer' to be thoroughly scraped free of the last remaining particles of flesh and blubber.

`black', and in the <i>Auckland Examiner</i>, `Boshee' [subscript 44] by people who had never seen a slave. The word `Maori' conjured up in the settlers' minds a stereotype based on experience in other colonies. [fn44] Perhaps a mixture of `bosh' and `Quashee', a West Indian negro.

Quote:  Emerging originally from children's slang to bulk quite considerably in a grown-up world is the serviceable term <i>bot</i>. Its origin seems to be medical, since in early uses <i>bot</i> is rendered as a germ, doubtless from bot-fly. [52] From this comes the phrase of greeting, <i>How are the bots biting?</i> By the 1920s a <i>bot</i> is being used extensively for a troublesome person, for a persistent borrower, a financial parasite. By 1925 the noun <i>bot</i> was translated to a verb, and as a result we have <i>to bot,</i> to borrow money, to impose on others, and <i>botting</i>, the practice. <i>To bot on</i> a person is widely used. An interesting extension to the term is to be found in Australia, in which country<i> to bite</i> is often the equivalent for <i>bot</i>. On the other hand <i>cold botting</i> is a straight-out request for food at house-doors. ... Of fairly recent development in New Zealand is the phrase<i> to have the bot</i>, to be sick or out of sorts, moody or disagreeable.

Notes:  By the 1920s a bot is being used extensively for a troublesome person, for a persistent borrower, a financial parasite. By 1925 the noun bot was translated to a verb, and as a result we have to bot, to borrow money, to impose on others, and botting, the practice. To bot on a person is widely used.

Quote:  Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies. ...When I first went to school, bottlies were good currency, being classed as two-ers, but usually sodawaters and black-bottlies counted as the
equivalent of six-ers. ... (Petone, Wellington, 1913)

Quote:  Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, [sic] chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II[roman] brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.

Quote:  Another New Zealand expression is `Up the Bouai' (pronounced boo-eye). There was a place near Auckland city which many years ago was somewhat isolated, and it was called the Bouai. The word is not Maori, for there is no `b' and no `h' sound in the original Maori tongue. Once more I cannot tell you where the word came from, but to go `up the Bouai' has become fairly general in use. Today, if a person comes to town from any lonely place in the forests or mountains, and a friend asks him where he has been, most likely the answer will be, `Oh, I've been up the Bouai.' It is a general word for an isolated region.

Quote:  Boundary keeper A shepherd who keeps sheep from passing an unfenced boundary. He goes along the boundary once or twice a day or, if he has a convenient lookout, watches the sheep all day. In the old days any boundary keepers lived on their boundaries all the year and never saw anyone, except at mustering or by chance. The Australian word `boundary rider' has never been used in New Zealand; in fact, a boundary rider's work is different. He looks after the fences and sheep in a large paddock. (C.)

Quote:  The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

Quote:  `A BOX OF BIRDS'

Sir, - I am aware that idioms in any language are often difficult to analyse, but there is one phrase used in New Zealand which leaves me completely puzzled. It is the expression `a box of birds,' given in reply to the greeting `How are you?' and is evidently intended to mean a state of well-being. This appears to be so completely irrelevant that I would be pleased if any of your readers could elucidate, if that is possible. The term suggests to me something to be prepared for the dinner table, but I am willing to be corrected. - I am, etc. KIWIPOM.

The circumstances are these: a) horses beyond 18 in any race are paired (bracketted) with a number, and hence a horse, already given (e.g. in a race of 20 entries, the last numbers would be 17, 17a, 18, 18a); b) similarly, when entries are more than can be safely run at one time and the race must be run in two divisions, each horse in the first division is paired (bracketted) with each horse in the second; c) (formerly) horses of the same ownership (galloping) or of the same ownership and trainership (trotting and pacing), running in the same race were bracketted.

Very seldom was harness used, and then without winkers, and it was called branks. The pulling strain came on the bows, and a yoke joined two bows and went over each neck of a pair of bullocks. If there were five pairs, say, a chain ran from the yoke of the first pair to the yoke of the second pair, and another chain from the second to the third, and another chain from the third to the fourth. These chains were lighter between the first pairs and heavier as you got further back. The two rear bullocks were yoked to the pole of the dray or waggon. As there were no reins, the driving was all by commands and cracking the whip. The calls were `Get up' or `Gee up' to start,
`Whoa' to stop, `Come here' to turn to left, and `Gee off' to turn right. If you came to a sharp corner, you would often say persuasively, `Way! Way! Come here.'' There is a general impression that bullocks could not be successfully driven without roaring oaths and curses at them, but this idea is a relic of early-day humour.

But English, like others in the so-called Shipley "brat pack", is conscious the government can deliver real benefits only if there is longterm growth in the economy.

Quote:   ... milch cows, and heifers ready to be broken in for milking. [fn] A friend tells me the expression `breaking in' requires explanation. ... A young cow [allowed to run wild] when first milked is generally `baled up', that is, her head is secured between upright posts so that she can raise or lower it, but cannot turn round to use her horns. ... A pint or less of milk is considered a satisfactory result of the first attempt to milk an `unbroken heifer'. When a cow has submitted to this process a few times without much struggling, she is considered to be `well broken in to milk'. <i>Ibid.</I> 242 A well broken cow for milking generally sells for nearly [pounds]20.

Quote:  Perhaps the commonest tree [near Waikouaiti] is one that I was not aware of having seen before. It grows to a considerable size, but in a very twisted, irregular shape. Its leaf is of a smooth, glossy, green colour, about the size of the leaf of a Portugal laurel, but more heart-shaped. The native name of the tree is kapuka. It is commonly called broad-leaf by the white men there.

This proved to be the remains of a juvenile Whitaker's skink, which made up about 70% of the stomach contents. The rest of the stomach's contents were comprised of the remains of a juvenile brown skink Leiolopisma zelandicum and three tiny invertebrates (a spider, an isopod and a fly) that may have come from the skinks' stomachs.

Brown skinks frequently co-exist with common skinks .. and at a few

in Marlborough Sounds on Stephens Island/Takapourewa and are likely to have once

done so in the Wellington area ...

<i>Cockfighting</i> (K-78). This was a free-for-all contest in which a smaller boy mounted on the back of a bigger boy and the two endeavored [sic] to dislodge all other riders by pushing or [202] pulling them over. ... Sometimes the game was known as a Piggy-back Contest or as Pulling Off. `One trick of the game was to "buck-jump" your rider, which consisted in jerking your elbows so that the rider was lifted over your head' (Naseby, Otago, 1905).

Quote:  BUCKJUMPING [title] ... August 23, 1856. I mounted my good mare `Lassie,' with the intention of leading the two packed horses, when to my astonishment her ladyship started buckjumping, and after a long fight, finding she could not throw me, suddenly stood on her hind legs and fell over backwards. ... Buckjumping is a horrid vice, although it is a very amusing performance - to the spectator. The horse tries to roll itself up into a ball, with all four feet close together, head down as near the ground as possible between the forelegs, tail well down, back stuck up like the hump of a camel when in good condition. Attitude is everything. Then commences the performance. With an active spring and rather a forward motion up you go in the air, and down again with a jerk, then up and down like an india-rubber ball, occasionally varying the action by jumping forward and kicking out behind with both legs at once, returning to the oval position as rapidly as possible, then turning round like a teetotum at
lightning speed.

The player who could stay on the longest was the rough-riding champion. Of a similar nature was Buck-jumping, in which individual players rode a macrocarpa or gum branch [113] to see who could rise the highest.

Quote:  <i>Buckley's chance.</i>-A correspondent from Kirwee, the same as explained <i>Jimmy Woodser</i> for me, writes that Buckley was one of the earliest convicts (perhaps the first) to escape from Botany Bay and take to the bush. It was then thought impossible to do this and live, as apart from the problem of food and water, the blacks were numerous and savage and reported to be cannibals. Extensive search was made, but no trace was found of Buckley; and it was concluded that the natives had got him. Any other convict who talked of escaping was invariably told that he would have `Buckley's chance' - hence the saying. However, many years afterwards Buckley was found to be still living. He had managed to make friends with a small band of natives who were moving to a remote part of the country, married one of their gins, and lived their life. The convict system had by that time been abolished, so the Government granted him a free pardon.

Quote:  A prominent feature ... is the massive pile of buildings which forms the central location of the Civil Service of the Colony. `The Buildings', as they are locally designated, have the appearance of being thoroughly substantial and permanent in character, and it is not a little surprising to a stranger, and destructive of his appreciation, to find that the ponderous edifice is constructed of wood. It is certainly claimed for the structure that it is the largest wooden one of a permanent character in the world, but that is a distinction which, even if it is deserved, is one perhaps of questionable honor.

Quote:  Naturally Scoticisms are prevalent, but only one or two will be noted here. On April 30, 1859, we read: `Duncan's flock buisted and earmarked,' and thereafter the word `buisted' is often employed. I understand it is an old Scots term for raddle or for marking with tar, etc., or for any marking which was not burnt in by the process invariably called branding.

Quote:  <i> [Notho]fagus fusca</i>,Hook. f. ... Tooth-leaved Beech. Black Birch of Auckland and in part of Otago and Southland. Black or Bull Birch of Lake Wakatipu. Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occured in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood.

Two Latin names, <i>S. laciniatum</i> and <i>S. aviculare,</i> are both more than a hundred years old but it was only in 1954 that Baylis defined clearly the difference between the two species and then the two names came into general use.

Quote:  If the English sailors have acquired a not undeserved reputation for their curses, surely the New Zealand bullock-drivers must be reckoned superior to them in this accomplishment, for such an assortment of fantastic oaths from all kingdoms of Nature, Heaven and Hell I have never heard before from mortal lips. Astounded I listened to this blue-eyed son of Albion and was at last impelled to ask him why he cursed so horribly; it could serve no purpose and only made the beast more stubborn. `You don't understand, Sir,' the young man answered. `I'm only speaking the bullock language. The animal certainly wouldn't understand or obey me if I spoke to him as I would to my horse. The bullock has been brought up to carry in this way, and if I want to get on fast, I've got to talk to him like this.' To this argument advanced by the driver with a good-natured smile I naturally could find no reply. I refer it to the linguists to enrol this new language in the appropriate family of dialects.

Quote:  Another play unknown at a later date was the widespread Bullock Teams: It was easy to make a team of working bullocks from pieces of supplejack, with their opposite branches doing duty as horns. The manufacture of yokes, substitutes for chains and model sledges gave a boy the pleasant feeling that accompanies successful achievement. Leading the team by a piece of string was the next step.

Quote:  In its simplest form bullrush involved one person standing in the middle of the field, then everyone else lined up on one side. The middle person would call someone's name (often in a rhyming way) into the middle. The object being of course to get past the middle to the other end of the field. If the runner was caught he or she joined the middle to call and catch more runners. Should a single runner get through there would be a bullrush, where everyone ran through the middle... These games had a thousand different names in earlier times: broken barley, king dick, punch king (where you had to punch the runner down!), goosey and so on... An excellent variation was.. cockarusha, in which everyone, instead of running, tries to hop through the middle.

Quote:  Is there one single New Zealamnder who has not played bullrush in some form or other?... There are variations. The main one is the classic 'bar the door' (which for some phonetically evolved into 'barbador'), where the main difference is that runners line up at both ends of the field. These games had a thousand names in earlier days: broken barley, king dick, punch king (where you had to punch the runner down), goosey and so on... Kerikeri school banned it (they called it king asini) three years ago.

Quote:  BULLIES: Sub-order GOBIOIDEA Bullies are not the same as cockabullies. The family these rather severe-faced fishes belong to is widely distributed over moderately warm and even tropical countries, and reaches its southern most distribution in New Zealand. The bully family is called Gobiidae by some writers, Eleotridae by others. Bullies are spiny-rayed fishes with the paired ventral fins placed well foward; they have a genital papilla for passing out eggs or sperms; and the males look different from the females. Two genera are recognised at present, <i>Gobiomorphus</i> and <i>Philypnodon. </i>

Quote:  The Lyttelton waterfront has been working under the bureau system of engaging labour for nine years now. ... `And,' the bureau manager said, `the men wouldn't like to go back to the old way again.' Under the old system, foremen of the various shipping companies stood on a small platform or block with the men awaiting employment before them and nominated those they required to work their own ships. The trouble with this `auction block' system, as it was called, was that each company tended to give preference to a certain group of men. It engaged the same men first all the time and employed others only when the preferred group were all at work. This meant very often the available work on the waterfront was not evenly shared; and that's what the bureau system tries to avoid.

burn
Homonym Number:
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition: (an instance of) clearing bush, scrub, unpalatable grass, etc. from the land by means of fire to improve pasture or to bring into cultivation by clearing logs or bush.

(There seems a distict cleavage between early South Island and early NI usage, cf. burn v1. In the South Island `a burn' was a periodical burning off of old tussock to prepare the way for good crop of new grass. In 20th century usage, however, has been applied (e.g. in the Pelorus Sounds) to burning off noxious weeds, fern, scrub etc. to get a good growth of green feed (cf. match-farming). In the North Island, `a burn' was chiefly applied to clearing away (felled) bush by burning, a burning off (or over) of unwanted bush: that is, to clearing or bringing land into cultivation, not merely to improving pasture. burn off seems chiefly used in this North Island sense (cf bush-burning))

Homonym Number:  2

Sense Number:
Definition: From the 1930s at least, according to W. Martin and Bob Adams of NZ Seamen's Union, a bad discharge from a ship, a transferred and figurative usage from stoking the furnace of a coal-burning ship. An inefficient or tyro stoker who built a bad fire had a `burn-out' in the furnace - i.e. the fire went partially out. He was allowed to get away with one of these, but on doing a second, was eased off the ship. Hence it came to mean a bad discharge in general.

As equipment we had a `bush devil', a sort of wire-straining outfit on which two men are expected to apply a pressure up to twenty tons, and a massive wrench. Hooking the strainer on to the base of a handy tree we got its claws, or whatever you call them, gripped on the long cable, above the turn buckle, and worked the lever until the joined sections were slack.

This peculiar wasting disease, which is confined to the tract of land lying in the vicinity of Tauranga, and extending from there to Rotorua and Lichfield, was made the subject of an investigation by Mr. Park three years ago... It appears that both sheep and cattle will do well and put on condition for the first few months after being placed on this diseased country, but as time goes on a gradual wasting sets in, which ends in death if they are not removed to another district.

The first bush jiggers were constructed early in the 20th century... The earliest confirmed jigger appeared in April 1908 when it was reported that a trolley had been built by Gamman at Te Ohu to convey 10-12 men to and from work... The principal use of bush jiggers was to get the bushmen to and from work. Compared to other options they were faster, safer,warmer, and drier. <i>Ibid.</i> 58 The development of the bush jigger spelled the end for most bush camps because they made it possible to travel to work over long distances in comparative speed and comfort.

A common method of raising money was called a `basket social'. A hall would be used for the function, and the people of the district would be invited to bring along baskets. Now these baskets were made of any material at all at hand, and it was remarkable the ingenuity and workmanship shown in making them. ... In the basket its maker put a supper, the food cooked at home ... [151] Now on the night of the basket social, all the baskets would be handed in ... They would then be auctioned, and the purchaser of the basket would have the pleasure and the honour of having supper with the provider of the basket. ... Now I've seen them pay twelve ... pounds in those days for a basket, just to make sure that the girl of the boy's choice saw that he really meant business. ... Every penny of that would go to the family in need ...

There was hardly a tree to be seen throughout the journey but the word has made its way over from Australia, and the traveller when he is out of town is in the bush. A country road which is merely formed and not metalled is a bush road, though it pass across an open plain, or up a treeless valley.

Lots of quick short words to fit in the breathless pauses as you pant uphill. `Crud' (cloud), `bush-bash', a `gunn' tramper (which must have originated from Davy Gunn's famous trek up the Hollyford Valley to help victims of a plane crash in 1936; he travelled 40 km by rowing boat, horse and foot in 21 hours), `windfall' (a collapsed pile of trees), `pit' (the tramper's true friend, a sleeping bag), `pog' (porridge), `bastard grass' and `lawyer' (two unpleasant plants), `piker' (one who stayed home), `Huey' (all-powerful god of weather), and many, many more.

Quote:  It was the final weekend of my bushcraft course... It had seemed a good idea on New Year's Eve when, dancing on a barrel at a Greek restaurant, I vowed: "This year I will drink less, eat more veges, and join a bushcraft course."... So, with the jeers of friends and flatmates ringing in my ears (apparently "bushcraft" carries connotations of hairy legs, bushy beards and unsavoury hygiene), I enrolled for a bushcraft course.

bushline
Homonym Number:  1
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition: the timber-line; the upper limit of the growth of bush A1 on a mountain; height at which bush ceases to grow (cf. timber-line (OED 1835) is occas. used in N.Z; cf. and cp. snow-line, which is more often used in the SI mountain-country. Whether one uses bush-line or snow-line depends upon the locality of the speaker, or the point of view of the speaker, e.g. a bushman would be more likely to speak of the bush-line, a mountaineer of the snow-line. bush-line and snow-line are only occas. synonymous. e.g. in mountain-country, in the summer, when snow is lying high or has disappeared, the bush-line stands out clearly, but is often called (locally and colloquially) `the snow-line': (cf. also scrub-line).

Quote:  A bushman always wore a special type of boot known as `ferntights', named because the upper part of the boot was sewn inside the lower leather, preventing sharp stakes from penetrating the seam and tearing the stitching. Round-headed hobnails were replaced with square-headed "bushman's springs" [sic].It was essential when standing on roots to have a firm footing and "bushman's

sprigs" helped to prevent us losing our

foothold on a slippery bank.

Quote:  About an hour after the second boil up for the day the affected person would feel an unnatural weakness stealing over him, his axe would grow excessively heavy, every blow would be an effort and a feeling of unreality as if working in a dream and a faint tremnbling of the limbs would assail him. Usually he would sit down and sharpen his axe for a minute or two then carry on chopping, the feeling slowly fading away in about half an hour. Among ourselves, to give this affliction an important sounding name, we always called it "Hydrophobia" but it is more generally called "Bushman's staggers," and is supposed to be caused by overworking the stomach at the same time as overworking the muscles.

They do not get wet as quickly as trousers, do not flap uncomfortably around the legs when wet, and keep the legs warm. Trampers often do likewise in snow and in cold wet windy weather when it is too cold for shorts.

Judging by a remark in the <i>Tramper</i> of 1933 there were articles known as <i>bushmen's trousers</i> on sale. These were a type of garment pretty much the same as long woollen underpants, but made for outer wear and provided with pockets.

[214] Bush-scouring was not a panacea for all circumstances, based on the inherent abilities of settler-frontiersmen, but a military method appropriate only in a certain context ... One assumption behind the bush- scouring theory was that the Maoris were evasive guerilla fighters ...

Quote:  There is no local grammar. The local usage which comes to mind, and it is not widespread, is the use of <i>but</i> as an adverb at the end of a sentence, an equivalent of <i>however.</i> ... The man who took our luggage in the air terminal at Sydney ... agreed [the Sydney climate] was good, then added `We've got central heating, but'. I first heard this usage in 1945 in Auckland among students at a Teacher's College, where it was a bit of an affectation or craze rather than established unconscious usage, but.

Quote:  <i>Penny Doctor</i> beetles, also known as `Butcher bats' is a game widely reported by Wellington Training College students as being played in many parts of the North Island. In this game straws moistened by spittle are pushed down the hole of the appropriate beetle. The beetle seizes the end of the straw. When the player feels the straw moving he or she flicks out the beetle. The player who can catch the most beetles wins the game.

Quote:  The most widely known game with insects is a game named variously by T.C. students as Butcher Boys (Gisborne, New Plymouth, Kaponga, [405] Te Pohu, Newall, Sth. Wellington), Butcher Bats (Ohau, Takaka), Penny Doctor Beetles (Tauranga, Pipiriki, Rotorua), or Fishing (Morunui). It is a game in which straws which have been suitably moistened with spittle are placed in an insects [sic] hole and are flicked out when the insect bites the end of the straw. Most of the reports of this practice come from the North Island, though it was known in the South as early as 1900 (Waikouaiti).

Quote:  In the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (In more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

Quote:  GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI) <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ...

The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter.

But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South Islanders as Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen.

Quote:  The Butterfish is very similar in form, and is related to, the Kelpfish (<i>Odax vittatus</i>), which is also a brightly-coloured species and found in similar situations, feeding on kelp and other marine plants in rocky localities. <i>Ibid.</I> 130 It is unfortunate that the Butterfish has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish but it should be remembered that in the North Island the Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>), a very different fish, is related to the Butterfish there is superficially little resemblance between the two species. <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish Coridodax pullus Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish

Quote:  Buzzy bee, made from 1948 by Auckland company H.E. Ramsay, was copied from a toy brought from the United states, the Ramsay family confirmed yesterday... A worker at the factory in 1948 brought an American Buzzy bee toy to Mr Ramsay, and suggested something similar be made...The American Buzzy bee was flat-sided, about one and a half inches thick, made from timber with a metal clacker and covered by painted paper. That accurately describes the Fisher Price bee, which Oamaru man Gerald Lynch-Blosse bought in Arkansas about five years ago.

Quote:  The need for a provision of this nature - sometimes known as BYOG, "bring your own grog" - has been widely recognised and provides a clear enough example of a case where the present law has fallen into disrepute because of its unreasonableness.

Quote:  The byre itself is a new-fangled

invention and I think it is the first of

its kind in Edendale... It holds 16 cows

at one bailing, and has double bails on

each side.

Quote:  And in case of readers who might say that last word [`husbandry'] is archaic I would remind that I was now in a [Southland] countryside where there were wee boys, along the road, and two of them were sailing their wee boats on a wayside pond. Also I saw nothing so ordinary as a cowshed, no indeed, instead there was Romance: byres.
