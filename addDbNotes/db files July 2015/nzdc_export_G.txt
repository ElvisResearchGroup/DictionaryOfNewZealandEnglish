Quote:  What may have been the shortest-lived New Zealand usage on record hit the headlines in May last year at the time of the women's rugbv union World Cup played in the Netherlands. As the Kiwi women rucked and ran their way with stunning ease to the title of world champions, they began to be described, by journalists initially, as the Gal Blacks, a name rather cleverly punning on (loosely rhyming with) that of their hitherto more illustrious male counterparts the All Blacks, whose classic black uniform they too wear.No sooner was the women's triumph complete, however, than it was made clear to all and sundry that the name bestowed on them was unacceptable both to the team itself and the New Zealand Rugby Football Union which administers both male and female rugby. NZRFU chief executive David Moffatt was reported as rejecting the name as inappropriate on the grounds that 'gal is an American slang term and certainly not what we want to call our team'. A replacement was promised, and in the meantime
most journalists and others accepted the name's red-carding. It was sighted however on the cover of the July 1998  issue of New Zealand Sport Monthly ('Where now for the Gal Blacks?'), whose editorial lauding the team's success said the name would have to do until something better came along... What is striking about all these current brand names is that without exception they derive directly or indirectly from the prototypical All Black name.   Even Gal Blacks, admittedly Americanised, was paying homage to its mana.

In Sydney,  Tasmania, and New Zealand it is <i>Hemirhamphus intermedius</i>, Cantor.; and in New South Wales, generally `Guard-fish,' and it is the river-fish <i>H. regularis</i>, Gunth., family <i>Sombresocida</i>. Some say that the name was originally `Guard-fish,' and it is still  sometimes so spelt. But the word is derived from <i>Gar</i>, in Anglo-Saxon, which meant spear, dart, javelin, and the allusion is to the long spear-like projection of the fish's jaws. Called by the <i>Sydney fishermen</i> Ballahoo, <i>and in Auckland</i> the Piper (q.v.).

The first is very small, and in a dry season merely drips from the rocks, and is called `Crying Jenny.' The second, which tumbles down from the mountains impetuously and with great noise, is `Roaring Meg.' The third, being a sluggish stream, has received, by popular assent, the designation of `Gentle Annie.'

Going over the hills some of the rest were grouching, but she tramped on lugging her swag ... singing to cheer them on. The creek was  called after her because of her brave spirit. That was said to be the reason of the name Gentle Annie, but I never heard how Roaring Meg got its name. There is a yarn nowadays that both were called after barmaids ...

Roxburgh and Cromwell are well behind, and I slow down ... to enjoy the sight of the water gushing from the spillway of the newly-erected power station at the Roaring Meg corner of the [Kawarau] Gorge. This heavy stream, which breaks so suddenly on a stranger from its very rough surroundings, got its name (according to early-day tradition) from the fact that Meg, one of the two girls on their way to a dancing saloon at Arrow, created such a fuss at crossing this turbulent water that vibrations of her voice loosened rocks on the mountain side to add still further to the roaring of the stream and of Meg herself. There are different versions concerning the naming of this stream, and maybe some of this one is my own. ... A few
miles further on the next stream to be crossed is the Gentle Annie, called after Meg's pal, who no doubt was a much quieter type of tourist than Meg herself.

Seated in a country tavern, Smith selected a battered love mussel from a pile of greasies, ingested it, clapped eyes on Jenny on screen, became viciously aroused, clutched his privates and rushed to the men's to relieve himself.

Two or there hours before a major storm hit I watched with binoculars for about 10 minutes the amazing sight of a huge sperm whale (estimated length 60 ft) leaping, time and again, almost completely airborne with his body surrounded by the tentacles of a giant squid. The tentacles appered to me to be almost as long as the whale, though possibly my memory tricks me.

Quote:  In 1909 Colonel Cosgrove, a New Zealander who had fought in the Boer War and had there met Sir Baden-Powell, as he was then known, and had talked with him about his ideas on Scouting, thought that the girls of New Zealand should have some Movement of their own. Scouting had already found its way to New Zealand, but there was no talk of Guiding for girls. So Colonel Cosgrove called his Movement "The Girl Peace Scouts"... The girls wore khaki dresses, which were very long, but no one seemed to mind. They had hats which turned up at the sides, carried staves on all occasions, and they always had a bugler! Troop flags and haversacks were also part of the uniform.



The girls did not believe in anything too tame, and had fearsome emblems such as curlews, moreporks, and peewits for their patrols. The knots were three pieces of ribbon tied in bows, to remind the girls of their threefold promise. The enrolment badge was very similar to the Girl Guide badge of to-day, with the letters P.S. (peace scout) on it... In October 1923 came official word that the Girl Guides' Association of New Zealand.. had been duly registered in London with Imperial  headquarters.

Quote:  GLOBE-FISH <i>Contusus richei </i>(Freminville) ... It has several other popular names such as Balloon-fish and Mouse-fish. In America it is known as Rabbit-fish and Stink-fish. The most humorous name is that of Publican-fish. The names Globe-fish and Balloon-fish were given because of the animal's habit of inflating itself with air to such an extent that the body was like a lamp globe or an inflated balloon. The Mouse-fish is the most popular among some fishermen and when the fish is distended it does present a striking resemblance to a mouse, with its cunning looking face. The name Rabbit-fish in America is so given because its teeth are like those of a rabbit. The most witty name, Publican-fish given to it by Australian fishermen, is said to have originated from the resemblance of an inflated Globe-fish to the rotundity of many successful publicans.

Quote:  All countries have their slang expressions, and New Zealand is no exception to the rule. `To go up for a skate' is one colonial idiom, and `To go up as high as [index to common names 283-293], baldfish 598-90 ' is another. Both colloquialisms are similar in meaning, but `To go up as high as Baldwin' had its origin in the 90's, after a visit to this country of the balloonist, Professor Baldwin. <i>Ibid.</I> 68 ...

The New Zealanders, for example, observing that the sailors on board the whaling vessels that touched at their ports uniformly carried an iron pot with them to cook their provisions when they went on shore, conceived the words Go ashore, which they were accustomed to hear when preparations were making for landing, was the proper name for an iron pot and they have accordingly been adopted as such in the New Zealand [Maori] language.

Quote:  Go-ashore: This [common utensil] was a round kettle-like pot of considerable dimensions with legs like a camp oven and with a handle to enable it to be hung over the fire. This was commonly called a `go-ashore'. Just how it got its name is not quite clear but the accepted explanation is as follows:- Early in the `white' history of New Zealand, some Maoris were anxious to know the name of the utensil. The white man addressed was not so much concerned about the enquiry as about landing, so instructed his companies to `go ashore'. Mistaking the

instruction for an answer to their question the Maoris applied the name `goashore' to this particular kind of kettle. Whatever the origin of the name, the `go-ashore' was a valued part of the early settlers' equipment.

Quote:  The earliest recorded use of the phrase was as the title of a poem about New Zealand written by Thomas Bracken sometime in the 1880s. It was published in a book of his poems in 1890, and then again in 1893 in a book containing a selection of his works, entitled Lays and Lyrics: God's Own Country and Other Poems.



God's Own Country as a phrase was often used and popularised by New Zealand's longest serving prime minister, Richard John Seddon. He last used it on June 10, 1906 when he sent a telegram to the Victorian premier, Thomas Bent, the day before leaving Sydney to return home to New Zealand. "Just leaving for God's own country," he wrote. He never made it, dying the next day on the ship Oswestry Grange.

If Mr. Seddon did use it first in New Zealand, then he was not being original, since the description had been applied by innumerable politicians in the last century to the United States of America. Ask any American which is God's own country, and he will not hesitate with his answer. It is regrettable that New Zealanders have been foolish enough to copy the phrase.-I am, etc., PEGASUS

Quote:  Gorge.-A correspondent has been good enough to remind me of a usage of this word which I believe is peculiar to Canterbury: i.e., any main valley above the (technically correct)

g. of a river. For instance, musterers always speak of Hakatere, Mespotamia, Manuka Point, Lake Heron, etc., etc., as being in the Ashburton, Rakaia or Rangitata  G. This usage goes back to at least 1894. As my correspondent says, `misty gorges are particularly prevalent in the MacKenzie Country'; so I suppose the usage will become poetical.

Quote:  Shinplasters.- The fact that private traders found it necessary themselves, to issue paper notes in

denominations below five shillings suggests that at the outset ... the Fitzroy notes were not issued for values below five shillings. The private paper notes were issued for small change, redeemable mostly in `Five Shillings, in Government debentures.' Both the debentures and the

private notes were issued on poor paper, and soon became known as `Government Rags' and `Shinplasters' respectively. The term `Shinplaster' for paper money appears to have come to New Zealand from America, via New South Wales. *[fn] In the latter Colony the issue of paper money of a denomination lower than twenty shillings was prohibited in 1826 to promote the circulation of sterling instead of a colonial currency, and the prohibition was welcomed by the people as `preventing the Colony being inundated with beggarly rags' and dollar and half-dollar notes `used often as a paltry contrivance to evade payment of debt,'  vide `The Australian,' 19 July 1826. [fn] Various reasons have been given for the origin of this curious term for paper money issued in the forties. The most likely explanation comes from America (p. 650  The Numismatist, 1938), where it is stated that in the good old days post-boys and out-riders, wearing high boots, were required, at times, to pay toll-fees at toll-gates, and in order to
facilitate progress they placed paper money or coins in bags in their boot-tops, against their shins - hence the term `shin-plaster.'

Quote:  The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as  `government rags', were given various nicknames such as assignats, `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past.  Assignats was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters'--sometimes written

`skinplasters'--had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.

Quote:  'What's the GV?' is the first question most buyers ask when they're in the market for a new house.



Actually, as of 1998 there is no such thing. The job of valuing properties moved out of the government arena three years ago. The valuation of properties became contestable, and the former Government  Valuation Department became a business called Quotable Value New Zealand (QV).



However, councils right around the country are still required by law to put what is now called a Rateable Value on properties, and in Nelson city the tender for this work was won by QV.



It is to be emphasized that the valuations are carried out totally independently of the council, with the property owner having the right to dispute the valuation with the valuer before they are set.

It is also correct that the council adopted a new policy this year which does not include this "grandfathering" fee... The new policy is consistent and fair and that means "grandfathering" of the traditional fees is no longer necessary.

Quote:  Brenda Walker wants to know what the dickens a local council was talking about in saying road encroachment fees would be grandfathered. The city fathers had undertaken to grandfather current fees for 10 years to defer the burden on those who had to pay them. I don't see the point in using this obscure term, except to show how knowledgeable you are, since the meaning is simply to defer the darn things. The technical meaning of a grandfather clause is temporary exemption from a law for people who were doing whatever they were doing at the time when legislation was passed. Originally, it referred to laws restricting voting to those who had the franchise before the  American Civil War.

The ground colour is black, mottled or waved with slaty-grey. At one time this fish was sold in Auckland and Wellington as Maori Chief but I do not know why this should be, as the true Maori Chief is quite different and not at all like the Granite Trout.

Quote:  In the Manuherikia Valley the gravel beds belonging to the series are termed, among the miners, the "granite" and the "granite wash"; though it is almost needless to say that any portion of the formation is quite innocent of <i>granite</i>, and none bears any resemblance to that rock except it be in the <i>hardness</i> of some of the cemented beds of quartz gravel.

Quote:  .. the alluvial miners thought they were dealing with superficial alluvial deposits; they called the conglomerates the `granite wash'. Deeper workings showed that the beds dipped steeply, and the

gold continued downwards, the conglomerates were then called `deep leads', probably in the belief that they resembled the deep leads of Victoria.

After the first flush of lambs, a lot of sheep come in,  wo-olly iwis [wou li: |i:wi:z] as they are called. They are tougher than lambs and the tally is therefore less - 80 instead of 100 say; and they are often called  grannies or grandmother lambs.

Quote:  Speaking of the Moonlight Ranges (Taringatura) he [Mr Roberts] says: - `The snowgrass was very rank and in flower, a greenish white, like rye grass. The speargrass was a great nuisance. There was a large celmesia, or cotton plant, growing very abundantly, the leaves long and narrow with a soft down on the under part of the leaf and a white flower like a large moon daisy.'

<i>Ibid.</i>  23 July 6. - I set out on foot ... and the long wet snowgrass soaked me to the waist. I crossed a swamp jumping from one Maori-head to another, but some were too weak to carry me, so I frequently slipped down into the mud, ... <i>Ibid.</i> Writing of the Waimea Plain in 1856: - `The ground was well grassed, but the speargrass was too plentiful. The pasturage was very good. There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

In Southland the kind they have there looks redder and is called locally <i>red tussock</i>. Sheep do not care for it, but it is so big that it sticks out of snow well and gives them a nibble. (C.)   `The grass is coarse and cold-looking--great tufts of what is called snowgrass ... [which] grows in a clump sometimes five or six feet in diameter and four or five feet high; sheep and cattle pick at it when they are hungry, but seldom touch it while they can get anything else. Its seed is like that of oats. It is an unhappy-looking grass, if grass it be.'`[Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],pp.74-5.

Quote:  On the mountains of both islands the WIRY DANTHONIA  (<i>D. setifolia</i>), so called because of the stiff, erect, acicular leaves, is the commoner species over wide areas. In Marlborough it is sometimes termed the NEEDLE GRASS, a name that is also and more aptly applied to a smaller cushion-forming plant of limestone country in the north of the South Island known as <i>Poa acicularifolia. </i>

<i>Arundo selloana, Gynerium argenteum, Cortaderia  argentea</i>, and <i>Cortaderia selloana</i>. It is a native of the northern parts of Argentine ... and not the `pampas' as might be conjectured. ... The differences between pampas and the closely related native New Zealand toetoe have been described by Dr. H.H. Allan and V.D. Zotov in the New Zealand Journal of Agriculture, Vol. 50, p.274.

Quote:  A kind of carpet grass was also in abundance. It grows in a dense mass and when one walks across it, especially on a steep slope, caution has to be exercised, for, if one slipped, he would go skating for yards, gathering speed all the way, as if he had slipped on ice. This carpet grass was like a very minute rush and grew thicker than grass on a well-grassed lawn.

Quote:  The name `couch' is often applied to any grass that spreads by means of underground rhizomes, but the following species are the ones that are most frequently termed `couch-grass': (1) Smooth-stalked meadow grass or Kentucky blue-grass  (<i>Poa pratensis</i>); (2) fiorin (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>); (3)  twitch (<i>Agropyron repens</i>); (4) Indian doob-grass (<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>); (5) buffalo-grass (<i>Stenotaphrum glabrum</i>). As the term `couch-grass' is a general one, it is better not to apply it to any single species.

From the Bay of Islands the plant spread south to Auckland. There, whilst on a holiday in the 'nineties, it was noticed by Harry Young flourishing on light sandy lands.

Quote:  PLANTAIN (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i>) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass' From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie'-that is `Charles and George'- a souvenir of 1745.

SOFT BROME (<i>Bromus mollis</i>). In common with several other weeds this is familiarly called goose grass, a name which on account of the confusion engendered by its use, had better be entirely dropped. It is also mistakenly called barley grass. It occurs in pastures and waste places in nearly every locality.

Quote:  So to cope with the rituals of tramping, its pains and camaraderie, a slang language has developed to suit. Lots of quick short words to fit in the breathless pauses as you pant uphill. `Crud' (cloud), `bush-bash', a `gunn' tramper (which must have originated from Davy Gunn's famous trek up the Hollyford Valley to help victims of a plane crash in 1936; he travelled 40 km

by rowing boat, horse and foot in 21 hours), `windfall' (a collapsed pile of trees), `pit' (the tramper's true friend, a sleeping bag), `pog' (porridge), `bastard grass' and `lawyer' (two unpleasant plants), `piker' (one who stayed home), `Huey' (all-powerful god of weather), and many, many more.

Quote:   If grass were to be mown, a stout piece of round iron, much more in diameter then a No. 7 wire, was fastened through the butt of the blade and a hole on the upper end was set to contain an ordinary screw into the wooden snaith. This gave stiffness to the blade and also gathered the cut grass in its sweep toward the winrow for the wooden rakes in the hands of the sun-bonneted women who followed. The stay was termed a grass nail.

Quote:  Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.

Quote:  Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, [sic] chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II[roman] brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.

Dunlop says driving the decision to develop the Greeline is the increasing emphasis being placed on and value being derived from lamb production. ... One of the results of the changing relativities between the returns from lamb meat and crossbred wool has been the development over the past decade of composite breed options such as the Greeline that followed the availability in New Zealand of the Texel and East Friesian.

that their `native emu' was the large type of kiwi (roa).

Quote:  GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI)  <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ... The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter. But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South
Islanders as Spotty  (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen.

Quote:  It is unfortunate that the Butterfish [<i>Corridodax pullus</i>] has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish ... <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish <i>Corridodax pullus</i> Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish ...

Quote:  There's no knowing what a knee is capable of and the doings of a breast are terrifying to contemplate. But when you combine them with large dangly earrings, you're in territory where a grey cardie would just have to close his eyes, hold his breath, and pray to the god of grey cardies... Prebble solemnly explained, as a grey cardie would, how he knew the score. He knew that earrings are a trouser-tease; he'd seen her little game; she wouldn't be lifting his cardie as easily as all <i>that</i>.

The first consisted of buying a series of 20 acre sections fronting on a road, [123] so spaced as to leave between them sections of 19 acres. Under the Waste Lands Regulations, none of less than 20 acres could be bought except by having it put up to auction. Few people would go to the trouble of having this done; and anyone who did was in all probability a man of small means, who stood little chance of outbidding the runholder. It usually happened, therefore, that all these 19-acre sections were retained without having to be purchased. This was known as `gridironing.'

[State Experiments 1902] 234) searches immediately for evidences of the methods by which the runholder retained his grasp of the land. These practices called gridironing and spotting can be defended: there is no need to do so here. If spotting is practiced - the purchase of selected areas with water and shelter for the control this gave over the surrounding country - a study of the Crown grant index maps and of the dates of the original titles supplies no evidence of it.

Quote:  The runholder was protected against intruders: cottages, fences and homesteads gave him a pre-emptive right over a set number of contiguous acres. Fences and cottages could be so disposed as to give the runholder rights over the best of the land -
Sources of water and wood, strips surrounding isolated and thus inaccessible pockets. `Grid-ironing' and `spotting', as these selective practices were called, were certainly used by many runholders to tie up large areas, but probably not to the extent alleged by horrified land tenure radicals in later years.

Quote:  A [112] powerful landowner ... had for years dominated the Haast Valley and his cattle wandered and grazed rent-free over the lush valleys and river flats - rent-free because he had leased all the access. This practice, called grid-ironing, was not uncommon and was undertaken by numerous big landowners.

Quote:  By accepting compensation [the Chinese community] would, in a single action, have joined the "grievance industry" - an activity synonymous with failure, inertia, and an unwillingness to accept a responsibility for one's own outcomes. The Maori grievance industry is unique as Maori are the indigenous people, and have a fulcrum of newly enacted laws around which to litigate, and they clearly suffer severe handicaps which they do not seem to be able to unilaterally resolve... Of concern is that we now have a large Pacific Islands minority coat-tailing the Maori grievance industry.

Quote:  Vervain (<I>Verbena officinalis</I>), a species few would suspect of harm, but which by overrunning grass has proved a nuisance in a small way, is an alien of note. It has invaded us from the north, a quarter from which comparatively few road-plants have come. Its proper name has been temporarily lost, it has been renamed, and, what must be almost unique in popular botanical nomenclature, that name again lost and the plant locally rechristened ; finally, it has resumed its correct designation. This alien from southern England appeared near Frazertown in the late 'seventies. It was first noticed on a station belonging to Mr Nairn; there it began to spread, and there it became known as Nairn's weed; the station then became the property of the late Mr Griffin. Now Mr Griffin, as chairman of the Wairoa County Council, touched the business and bosom of every up-country settler in the district. People knew him who did not know and had never known his predecessor; his office advertised the plant :
presently, even in the [299] immediate vicinity of its origin, the earlier designation was dropped, the later one

assumed. It became known up and down the east coast as `Griffin's Weed'.

Quote:  From this data we may conclude that every variety of wheat has a definite amount of growth to make, which occupies a definite number of normal "growing-days" (according to the variety grown) .. the remedy lies, when spring-sowing, in the selection of a variety which will not require a greater number of "growing-days" in a normal season.. Each variety of wheat, grown under normal conditions, will require a certain number of "growing-days" after seeding before it is fully developed..The number of growing days required varies according to the variety.

grunting noise is caused by the escape of air from the air-bladder through the pneumatic duct.

The name Butterfish used in the North Island for them is from the yellow or buttery colouring on the undersurface. In Canterbury they are called Guffy, but for what reason I have yet to learn. It is a very pretty fish, more especially when seen in the water.

We found it first in small lumps upon the Sea beach, but afterwards found it sticking to the Mangrove trees and by that means found out from whence it had come. [fn 1955] ...

Quote:  I'd always meant to have a yarn to Willie about the 'gumboot' or 'Abel' clone and foolishly kept putting it off. The gumboot clone (a clone in this case is simply a vine cutting) was so called because it was discovered inside the gumboot of a returning Kiwi by a customs officer at Auckland airport. It is seen as important to have a mixture of different clones to make great pinot and Ata Rangi owes about a third of its content to the gumboot clone.

sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram  lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until  cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a  two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a  four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an  eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

<i>Ibid.</i>  96 Gummy. An old sheep that has lost all its teeth and reached the end of its useful existence.

Quote:  The gum-spear, a slender, rapier-like instrument, fitted with an ordinary spade handle, varied in length from about three feet for use in shallow ground, to twenty-five or more for working deep swamps. Some time after its introduction, the spear came to be fitted with what was called the

`joker,' or `toggle'. This was a coil of fine wire, bound round the spear [50] a few inches from the point. It allowed the spear to be thrust into the ground with the minimum of resistance, there being no `drag' on the shaft. It is said that the forerunner of the `joker' was discovered by accident. A digger, pushing his spear into the ground, found that it had penetrated a boot-eyelet,

and was surprised to find that, instead of forming an obstruction, the spear penetrated the ground more easily; the coil of fine wire was devised as an improvement. An experienced digger could detect at once, by the feel, and the resistance met by the spear, whether he had struck timber, a stone or gum.

Quote:  In contract sheds only fast men are welcomed by the `boss'. Some men who are what we term `guns,' are kept going all the season, and in many cases good honest shearers are cast off to make room for these `guns.' Of course, the `gun' shearer who comes along does not know that this has

happened, as the `gun' shearers are as a rule good unionists, and would not demean themselves by `waiting for a death.' At the same time, the `boss' knows when the gun is cutting out, perhaps 200 miles away, and he knows from the other boss which way the `gun' is going, and everything is in readiness when he arrives at the shed.

Quote:  <i>Gurnet</i> ... [<i>Gurnard</i> cross-referenced to<i> Gurnet</i>]  The species of <i>Trigla</i> found in British waters, called <i>Gurnards</i> are of the family of <i>Cottidae.</i> The word <i>Gurnet</i> is an obsolete or provincial form of Gurnard, revived in Australia, and  applied to the fish <i>Centropogon scorpaenoides</i>, Guich., family  <i>Scorpaenidae</i>. The original word <i>Gurnard</i> is retained in New Zealand,

and applied to the new species <i>Trigla kumu (kumu</>being the Maori name), family <i>Cottidae</i>. The <i>Flying Gurnet</i> is <i>Trigla polyommata</i>, Richards., found on all the Australian coasts from New South Wales to Western Australia, family <i>Cottidae</i>. It is a distinct species, not included in the British species. They have large pectoral fins, but are not known to possess the power of supporting themselves in the air like the `flying fish' which belong to other genera. Sir Fredk. McCoy says that <i>Sebastes Percoides</i>, Richards., is called Gurnet, or Garnet-perch, by the fishermen and dealers, as well as the more common <i>Neosebastes scorpaenoides,</i>  Guich., and <i>Scorpaena panda</i>, Richards.
