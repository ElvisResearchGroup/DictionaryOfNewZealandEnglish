Notes: ca1940 at least traditional children's rhyme version of Old King Cole Old King Cole was a merry old soul/ And a merry old soul was he;/ He called for a light in the middle of the night/ To go to the W.C../ The wind blew round the W. door/ The candle had a fit;/ Old King Cole fell down the hole/ And came up covered in [shit] sweet violets; violets for ladies: Covered all over from head to toe, Covered all over with/ Sweet violets.

Quote: It was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.

Now the old wagga was popular in the wintertime - a bit heavy to carry, but it came into its own in the winter. The wagga rug was made out of the old one-striper sacks... The old one-striper was the fair-dinkum chaff sack, because of course at that time oats and chaff were still used a lot for horsefeed... The old heavy one-striper made a wonderful wagga.The wagga originated over on the Aussie side, and generally to improve it you opened up two sacks, and this made a wonderful rug.

Whitebait are pretty stupid, but occasionally they get it in their tiny minds to swim around your net instead of into it. This is when you need a swaggle stick. A pole, five yards long, with a shiny tin lid attached to the end. You stick it in the water and try to scare the recalcitrant whitebait back on course.

Quote:  `In selecting a portion of land for a settlement, it would be advisable to take care that it be as clear as possible of what the natives call the wahhe tabboo (<i>wahi tapu</i>). Wherever a person has breathed his last, or his bones have been laid for a time, there is always a piece of timber set up, if there is no tree already growing, to perpetuate his memory. This wahhe taboo is not suffered to be molested, and is held sacred both by friends and strangers.

Some men who are what we term `guns,' are kept going all the season, and in many cases good honest shearers are cast off to make room for these `guns.' Of course, the `gun' shearer who comes along does not know that this has happened, as the `gun' shearers are as a rule good unionists, and would not demean themselves by `waiting for a death.' At the same time, the `boss' knows when the gun is cutting out, perhaps 200 miles away, and he knows from the other boss which way the `gun' is going, and everything is in readiness when he arrives at the shed.

Quote: The yellow-eyed penguin filled a niche after the Waitaha became extinct after the arrival of Polynesians between 1300 and 1500AD .. The Waitaha penguin is believed to have been closely related to the yellow-eyed penguin, but smaller. It was named after the Waitaha iwi, an early South Island people, lost through marriage and conquest. Waitaha penguin bones were found from Nelson to Southland.

Quote: Waka were built for inland and coastal waterways, but were no longer needed for ocean voyaging. New types became common in Maori communities - waka taua, waka tete, waka tiwai, mokihi, and the modern-day waka tangata .. A late 20th century development has been the construction of canoes for educational purposes. Known as waka tangata, they are very similar to waka tete, with uncarved gunwales and stern posts of simple ornamentation.

Quote: In these important respects Wakefield's system offered useful, practical hints for colonizers. On the whole, however, it failed to work. The experiments in New Zealand produced colonies-but not `Wakefield' colonies. It proved impossible to regulate either the expansion of the frontier or the form of class structure by means of a price upon land.

In this species, the frond usually produces a single bulbil at the very tip, so that when it arches over and touches the soil, the bulbil roots and grows out into a new plant. This growth habit makes it an excellent subject for a hanging basket.

It should be `Phasma', and the hyphen placed between `walking' and `stick' should be omitted - the common name having been given from its resemblance to an animated twig, and not (as the hyphen would suggest) from any resemblance to a stick we use in walking.

But before you rush off to the Race Relations Office, hear Rood out. He has been selling Wanganuis for years, long before the place became a byword for urban renewal, and the recipe dates back to the 1930s when someone from Wanganui worked in the shop for a while... For the record, a Wanganui costs $1 and consists of butter cream wedged between biscuits darkened by cocoa powder. What next - chocolate kenmairs?

If the sheep were hot- water washed, their owner had to build an expensive apparatus. The remains of these <i>sheep washes</i> were not uncommon twenty years ago. If there were technical terms for this process they are not recorded here, except that the most important place was at the spout. Everybody used to get very wet.

The boss kept steam up and attended to the mill adjustments and lubrication, three men worked in the bag hole, the bag-rammer, the bag-sower, and the bag-carrier; two men were on top of the mill, a band cutter and a man to turn the sheaves to the band cutter: two men were on the stack forking to the `turner', and then there was the chaffy, two men on the straw stack, a builder and a straw `walloper' and last of all, the water joey. Threshing out of the stock required an even larger gang, usually about three more men.

Quote: Water-race companies often made their fortunes more easily than the miners ... From January 11 to March 11 1870, the miners of Naseby went on strike, and finally induced the `water-squatters' to lower their rates from five pounds a `Hogburn' head, to two pounds. [fn] A `Hogburn' head was the stream of water which would run through a box seventeen inches wide by one inch in depth with five pounds of pressure.

An English lecturer in geography tells me that she has spent much time in trying to eradicate this usage from the essays of geography students.

Let go.'/ Wareleggo is the musterers' call to a dog to come back and I believe it's supposed to be a sort of portmanteaux [sic] word made up of `Way-here-let-go,' meaning let go the sheep and come away here. Rather far-fetched perhaps but I know of no other explanation. The word is so characteristic that Peter Newton - the author of two books by a high-country musterer about high-country life - used it as a title to epitomise the spirit of his first book.

Quote: Colonel Malone noted the incident cryptically in his diary: April3. Riot in Cairo last night. Some of the Australians and New Zealanders wrecked some brothels where they had been badly treated. If they had burnt the quarter down it would have ben a good thing. This was the so-called `Battle of the Wazza', named for the street in which the attack took place: the Haret el Wasser near Shepheards Hotel. In this quarter on Good Friday 1915, several hundred Australians and New Zealanders sacked and set fire to the brothels while thousands more watched.

In fact, the term "bomb' has been used in North America for more than 20 years to describe rapidly intensifying lows, some of which have ben known to deepen by 60 hPa in 24 hours off the  east coast of the United States. One definition of a bomb is a low that deepens at a rate of 24 hPa in 24 hours at latitude 60. When adjusted to the latitude of Auckland to allow for the effects caused by the curvature of the earth's surface, this is the equivalent of 17 hPa in 24 hours.

The specimens intergrade to such an extent that precise limitation of species is extremely difficult, but Sir W.L. Buller set them out as these two in 1878, regarding other specimens as varieties. The birds are sometimes called <i>Weka-Rails</i>, and the Maori name of <i>Weka-pango</i> is given to the<i> Black Wood-hen (O.fuscus, </i>Du Bus.).

Quote:  ...it is worthy of notice, that the colonists, soon after the formation of all the settlements, acquired distinguishing epithets; thus there was an Auckland cove, a Wellington swell, a Nelson snob, a Taranaki exquisite, an Otago cockney, and a Canterbury pilgrim. These epithets, almost already forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; and the origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation.

Quote: After all, this is a film about Westies, written and directed by a Westie, designed to put the Westie play-hard go-hard subculture up on the screen. I suspect this is a sanitised version of the real thing, but there's still enough here to appeal to the Westie in all of us. (Go on, indulge your inner hoon.)

Quote: `West Coast' continued to be used in the 1860's, but after 1864 the official names, `West Canterbury' and `Nelson South West', had some popular currency. Then a further complication was introduced. In 1859 John Rochfort had had coined the name `West land', a shortened form of `Westmoreland', the name he used on a map showing his West Coast explorations. After August 1865 the form `Westland' was resurrected and was used both for electoral and judicial districts which covered part or whole of the West Coast. Popularly, however, `Westland' was used chiefly for West Canterbury; the remainder of Canterbury Province was sometimes called `Eastland'. West Canterbury became the County of Westland in 1868 and the Province of Westland five years later. The Nelson South-West Goldfield kept this official name until 1876 when the provinces were abolished.

Quote: `West Coast' remains the popular term for the strip of country on the wrong side of the Southern Alps, though recently New Zealand geographers have adopted `Westland' for the whole West Coast. Whatever its merits, this term is unsatisfactory. It has some popular currency south of Greymouth, and it may acquire popularity through its teaching in the schools; but at an indefinable point north of Greymouth one is likely to be told, `This isn't Westland, this is the Buller'. A region itself so distinctive is also marked by strong local feeling. In 1960 `Westland' celebrated its centenary; `the Buller' did not.

Quote: Established by plebiscite at election time in New Zealand there were 'wet' areas where pubs could be built and liquor sold, and 'dry' areas where they could not. In the case of Henderson the divider between wet and dry was the local railway line, and Mr Assid Corban, a Lebanese who had planted vines and was making wine, found his house and sheds on the dry side of the tracks. This problem he solved by buying tom the railways a very small earth-floored concrete shelter, only a few yards from his house but across the tracks on the wet side. From there he began selling wine in flagons to passing motorists.

Quote: He explained to his readers that there were two kinds of diggings, the `wet' and the `dry'. The first were in the bed of the river, the water of which had often to be diverted in order that the diggers might wash the gold taken out. If these diggings offer a larger profit to those who strike the right spot, they have the disadvantage, that the necessary labour is hard and unhealthy, for the diggers must often stand breast-high in the cold water from the mountains. ... The dry diggings, which generally require more capital and strength, are to be found mostly on the heights or in the higher diluvium. The water must often be brought long distances in sluices. The earth containing the gold is thrown into the sluices, in which a double floor with numerous bored openings lie.

Quote: <i>Ages of sheep.</i> Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a <i>lamb</i> until weaned. After weaning a lamb is called a<i> hogget</i> until shorn. A male lamb is a<i> ram lamb</i> until castrated, then a <i>wether</i>. A female lamb is a <i>ewe lamb</i>. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a <i>shorn hogget </i>until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a<i> two-tooth.</i> Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a <i>four-tooth,</i> then a <i>six-tooth</i> and then an<i> eight-tooth </i>or<i> full-mouthed</i> sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

To abstain from such behaviour invites endless ribbing, accusations that you're a poofter or effeminate."

Quote: The play was a lament for the innocence of a lost small-town rugby culture, nowhere more powerful than in the concluding (and very theatrical) "lament" - a long monologue wherein Foreskin poured out his misery, his inability to cope with his lost sense of self. The final words were the cry "Whaddarya? Whaddarya? Whaddarya?", as eloquent an interrogation of our notions of masculinity as New Zealand literature has produced.... Maybe the original play (and especially its conclusion) was just too theatrical to be filmed. Or maybe somebody should ask Greg McGee if he's an insightful commentator on New Zealamnd mores, or a purveyor of bland entertainments of "international" (that is, nowhere) appeal. Whaddarya?

Quote: The concept and meaning of whakamaa are difficult to explain concisely in English. However, the word is generally translated to mean one of these three things shy, embarrassed, or ashamed... Whakamaa most often occurs for Maori people, either as individuals or as members of a group, when they are placed in a situation where they perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage and thus to have a lower status. Whakamaa, therefore, has a lot to do with mana, which is most often translated by Maori people to mean power or authority... Third, utu or making amends requires restoring a person's or group's mana. Metge concludes that whakamaa will continue until a person or group is re-integrated with and placed in their proper position within a community.

Whakapapa were used to validate tribal mana and claims to the land, functions which were properly recognised by the Native Land Court.

This tea, an infusion of `manuka' boughs, is a beverage much drunk by the whalers; it is very wholesome, and, not palatable at first, appears to be agreeable to those who have become accustomed to it.

The worst thing that can happen to a Maori is to be ostracised by his/her family group. Whanau refers to more than the nuclear family - the extended family of Aunts and Uncles have rights and responsibilities over a child - `whaea' can mean mother and aunt.

Quote: Traditionally, the whanau was an extended family which incorporated three generations. At the head of the whanau were the kaumaatua (male elder) and kuia (female elder). Their whanau (offspring) lived with them or nearby. These included their children, adult children and spouses, and their grandchildren. Sometimes aged siblings of the kaumaatua and his wife were also included. This meant that a whanau could number up to 20 or 30 members.

Quote: For those without whanau, the original institution is occasionally replaced by a quasi-whanau of a non-kin support group. In the western districts of Auckland there is a group known as Te Whanau o Waipareira. Now, since Waipareira is a district and not an ancestor, the term is a misnomer. The group is also much larger than the conventional whanau because of its open-ended nature. It is capable of taking in all those who live in the district and wish to belong.

Quote: ``Futtah' is familar as `household words'. There were always rats in New Zealand--that is, since any traditions of its <i> fauna </i> existed. The original ones were good to eat. They were black and smooth in the hair as the mole of the Old Country, and were esteemed delicacies. They were always mischievous, but the Norway rat that came with the white man was worse. He began by killing and eating his aboriginal congener, and then made it more difficult than ever to keep anything eatable out of reach of his teeth. Human ingenuity, however, is superior to that of most of the lower animals, and so the `futtah' came to be - a storehouse on four posts, each of them so bevelled as to render it impossible for the cleverest rat to climb them. The same expedient is to-day in use on Stewart Island and the West Coast in fact, wherever properly constructed buildings are not available for the storage of things eatable or destructible by the rodents in question.' ... ][Futtahs are today in use on Stewart Island and the West Coast. -

Quote: Amongst the strange ornithological forms that occur in New Zealand is a very remarkable bird of the owl tribe, called the `wekau' by the natives. It is rather larger than the ordinary screech-owl, spotted with chestnut and black, and has long legs, and small green-coloured feet. The head is very small, and the beak like that of a hawk, thus imparting somewhat of an accipitrine character to this anomalous owl. It is found in the Middle Island, where its habits are, from its conformation, no doubt terrestrial. Its scientific name is <i>Sceloglaux albifacies. </i>

Thus Kawhia in the North Island is pronounced `Kafhia,' and so in all instanced, The meaning of the word is `red,' or is more generally used to indicate anything brightly coloured.`Simon' - the word used by Mr Archibald - is probably a corruption of `timata,' strongly accenting the `i.' It means `heavy' - and in this connection, `heavy stones.'

Quote: A `whip-behind' was used by children for a swinging ride behind a cart or wagon - perhaps from the driver having to turn around and try to slash them off behind with his whip; perhaps from using the momentum of the cart to get a whip-like release; perhaps from `whipping' (that is, dashing quickly there and away again) in behind the cart for a ride. It was said, e.g.,: `I'll give you a hiding if you whip behind the baker's cart again!' My father remembered this word from when he was a boy in Dunedin in the 1870s to 1880s.

Quote: The coach to Dunedin used to stop at Fagerty's Hotel for watering the horses, which were glad of a spell, and then we got ready to hang on behind. The boys who could not get hold of a strap or something would call out, `Whip behind,' and one ill-natured driver did it, too, as the coach went on. Once one of us tripped, and a heap of boys fell in the wet and mud. Dick and Bob Runciman and my little brother Dick were covered with the slurry from head to foot. We got them cleaned somehow and went on to school. (1868; Green Island, Dunedin)

The netball teams has dibs on the Silver Ferns and the rugby team has claimed the Black Ferns. Guess that only left one option, really. It's certainly not the most menacing of names. In keeping with the Black Caps, perhaps the side should have been named the Black Cats. At least it would conjure up images of claws and fangs, and not pretty native shrubs. [Rachel Smalley]

Quote: A clear frontrunner for each and any marketing, public relations or packaging award in the `best socio-intellectual catch-phrase of `86' category: `White flight.' Think about it, talk it out, see and hear how it rolls off your tongue. Doesn't matter what it means or involves or entails - the two-word phrase is the attention-grabbing winner of the year. With such curt alliteration, it doesn't matter that what's in contention is actually a complex educational, socio-economic and racial issue. It has miraculously been reduced to the limits of the number of letters an <I>Evening Post</I> headline writer can squeeze into a front-page banner, which number also equates to the newspaper's collective IQ. So what the hell is `white flight' anyway? According to race relations conciliator Wally Hirsch, it's that startling new phenomenon of honky parents taking their kids away from schools whose rolls have significant numbers of different-tinted folk. -->1986 May 23 Dominion 14 Sir, - Much has been said about the `white flight' from Maori schools. I assure you this is not new. When we lived near Rotorua in the 1960s, people of Pakeha descent would pay to send their children miles to school, rather than send them to schools with a predominantly Maori roll.

Quote: There are twenty-eight native species belonging to the genus <i>Odontria,</i> but all observers agree that the principal grass grub is <i>Odontria zealandica.</i> In the larval stage this is known as `grass grub,' `white grub,' or `curl grub,' and the adult stage is known as `grass grub beetle,' `brown beetle.' or `turnip fly.'

Quote: All the attention of agriculturists is now turned to the destruction of the white grub or worm that is neither more nor less than the larva of the cockchafer, that great favourite of schoolboys, but in reality one of the most mischievous insects of the temperate zone, and capable of committing as much havoc as the locust in warm climates.

Quote: MINNOW or WHITEBAIT (INANGA) <i>Austrocobitis attenuatus</i> (Jenyns) ... For a long time it has been known to the Maori and to Europeans that our New Zealand Whitebait is the young of a native freshwater fish commonly known as Minnow, or Inanga or Hiwi to the Maori, and erroneously called a Trout. ... The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. In the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.

This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai.

The name White-throated Shag is also in general use for the most abundant phase of a rather variable species which, at its other extreme, is identical with the Little Pied Shag of Australia. However, as intermediates occur, and the Little Pied form is relatively uncommon, it seems more convenient to treat the New Zealand population as a variable one under a distinctive name.

Quote: Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, [sic] chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II[roman] brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.

The word illustrates the lack of standardization in these seldom written words: I would have spelt it <i>wopcacker</i>. Baker records the word as whopcacker but gives a slightly variant meaning, as `very good', `bonzer', `snitcher', `rumptydooler', and the many synonyms of these words.

Quote: During the early months of this year [1956] much publicity was given in the Christchurch newspapers to the fact that large numbers of young people were to be seen, especially at the weekends, in the central areas of the city. These young people congregated in the streets and milk-bars. Many of them had motor-cycles ... At various times these young people were referred to as `Teddy Boys', `Milk Bar Cowboys' and `Bodgies and Widgies'...  [2] Bodgies and Widgies are members of a closely knit sex cult. This cult is centred and operates actively in Australia (and especially in Sydney). As far as is known, the cult itself does not operate in Christchurch, though [3] many boys and girls imitate its fashions and share with its adherents an interest in jive. The dress of these youngsters resembles that of the Teddy Boy and Girl, but is not so immaculate; hair is worn long and brushed back, without the characteristic Teddy Boy tuft; behaviour tends to be more boisterous and `attention provoking'. In this report such phrases as `Teddy Boy style' or `Bodgie type' are used purely as descriptive terms, to indicate certain fashions of dress which show these overseas influences.

Quote: Incoming skins are sorted to arbitrary standards - wigs (old males), clap-matches (females), bulls, yearlings, grey or silver pups (under one year), black pups. If the cargo is intended for the European or American market, the skins are removed from the animal with an inch of blubber adhering, and in the final simple treatment are washed, heavily slated, and then folded or `booked' into rectangular shape for packing. Skins destined for China, however, are treated with more preliminary care. They are taken as cleanly as possible, and after careful washing are sent to the `beamer' to be thoroughly scraped free of the last remaining particles of flesh and blubber.

Quote: Hokitika.. is having its 13th Wildfoods Festival... Festival organiser Mike Keenan says the great thing about Wildfoods is that everybody gets a piece of the pie... Wildfooders seem to be tribal by nature and come dressed in matching Hawaiian shorts of T-shirts with club insignia such as "Booze hags, pissed since 1976" scrawled across the bosom.

Quote:  [Fantastic plant-names] show the imagination running riot; they seem appropriate though often it is impossible to give any definite reason for the name. No trace has been found for the name `wild-irishman' as applied to Discaria toumatou. Many old settlers have been questioned without result, or with such barren result as the following: One being asked, `Why was the wild-irishman called the wild-irishman?' answered `I suppose because it is like a wild Irishman.' `What characteristics have they in common?' `Well, I-I-I really can't say.' And so it is; it is a name that everyone understands, but no one can explain. Whilst it is often written with a capital, it is now as often written with a small letter, `irishman'.

The Number 4 began running along the back of the lineout. The halfback of the day kept pace with him. Other forwards, 2, 3 and 5, tailed after him. Number 6 or number 7 tensed and poised and made ready to spring into the air to touch, tap or grab and pass the ball down into the arms of the first runner. And within seconds, the whole pack was shambling in his wake into the the [sic] open field, ... This was `Willie Away', a favourite ploy of the 1963-64 All Black Rugby Union team from New Zealand while they were on tour of the British Isles, France and British Columbia between October 1963 and the end of February 1964. The name came from the captain, Wilson James Whinerary, who was the principal instrument in it ... .

Quote: I didn't think I'd had an especially good game although I did do the Willie Away move a few times. <I> Ibid.</I> 291 In 1961 the `Willie Away' move was born. It was inspired by the French touring team who, although they lost all three tests, had Whineray's men sweating at Eden Park ... `The French kept peeling off the rear of the lineout and driving up the middle of the field. ... we thought if we could create a blindside by driving up midfield from a lineout ... we could extend the move where it kept dying out with France.'

Quote: The skipper ... was a French Canadian. There were three men besides, one an old whaler, another a native of Nova Scotia, the third ... [from] the Azores ... [We] entered Queen Charlotte's Sound. By this time the wind had increased to a gale from the North West, and blowing over the low ridge which divides the Sound from Port Gore, it came to us in `williwaws', that is, violent puffs, succeeded by temporary calms. You can see the Williwaw coming from a long distance; the sea is blown up in a cloud of spray; curling and whirling it sweeps down upon you, and immediately before it comes, `Let go,' shouts the skipper, and the fore and main sheets are let go, blocks rattle, masts strain, canvas flaps violently, and the weight of wind forces the vessel nearly on her beam ends. Then in half a minute it is nearly a dead calm.

Quote: A special inconvenience [in Queen Charlotte Sound] introduced me to a new word - viz., the `willy waughs', [[fn] Thus was I instructed to spell.] brief gusts of wind that blew across the sound, carrying spindrift with them. Sometimes, crossing the mouth of a bay, we caught these gusts full and were well-nigh drenched. ... In Wellington I was assured that `willy waugh' was a Scotch word, also that it was a corruption from the Maori `wirriwa', which I later found did not exist. On my return to my dictionaries in Melbourne, I found the word in the Standard as Patagonian. `Willi-wa, a violent wind from mountains in the fiords of Patagonia'. An this be true (and I can find no more about it), by what process, through what book, did the word pass from Patagonia to Queen Charlotte Sound? The `willi-waught' of `Auld Lang Syne' means a draught of liquor, a long drink, not a sprinkling of wet externally.

Lots of quick short words to fit in the breathless pauses as you pant uphill. `Crud' (cloud), `bush-bash', a `gunn' tramper (which must have originated from Davy Gunn's famous trek up the Hollyford Valley to help victims of a plane crash in 1936; he travelled 40 km by rowing boat, horse and foot in 21 hours), `windfall' (a collapsed pile of trees), `pit' (the tramper's true friend, a sleeping bag), `pog' (porridge), `bastard grass' and `lawyer' (two unpleasant plants), `piker' (one who stayed home), `Huey' (all-powerful god of weather), and many, many more.

Notes: The term arose when about Sep/Oct 1992 Mr Stephen Lunn of Auckland put some documents into a cardboard winebox and then released them to the public. The term winebox inquiry was first used ofthe Parliamentary Select Subcommittee on Finance & Expenditure when it began looking into the matter and was later transferred to the Davidson High Court(Cook Islands) Commission.When faced with a court writ on publication, the Independent ran a fable on a mythical country called [South]Wogistan in which the basic details were revealed. The term Wogistan is said by the Independent in last week's issue in acolumn by Chalkie (? Berryman) to have gained some currency in circles interested in the Winebox affair and maybe worth picking up - I have the references. It's very PC. The first published use of the term winebox of documents may have been made by Paul East in Parliament [NZPD, p. 539]

The summer country was mostly comprised of the higher ranges and those lying away from the sun where the winter snowfall was heavy. Sheep were run on this range country through the summer months only, and brought down to the lower country - the winter country - in the late autumn. This consisted of rolling downs, the lower hills, and faces lying to the sun where snow did not lie.

There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side.

Quote: We call these trees and shrubs that can resist browsing by birds 'wire plant' in recognition of their tough, sinuous stems and their uniqueness to New Zealand... A very few wire plants are able to cope with mammals and this accounts for why they remain common. These have spines (for example matagouri) and the ability to form impenetrable hedges... Wire plants are perhaps best recognised by the tugging test - take a shoot of less than three millimetres in diameter, and pull. If it is hard to break then it is probably a wire plant!

In 1942 it was reorganised as the Women's Land Service, with better pay and conditions, plus a full working kit and dress uniform as an added attraction... The WLS was the "ugly duckling" of the auxiliary service, despite their years of arduous work and extraordinarily long hours.

Wooden roses are the deformed roots of trees or shrubs, the deformation being caused by the attack of another plant, the root-parasite, Dactylanthus taylori. It is found most abundantly on the volcanic plateau in the centre of the North Island, but also in other parts of the same island.

This seems to me a commoner meaning for boo-ay than `backblocks', `remote rural districts', mentioned by Keith Sinclair, in the <I>Pelican History of New Zealand,</I> with suggested derivation from the settlement at Puhoi. Since the backblocks are already called the <I>woop woops</I> (the form given by Partridge who says it is mainly restricted to New South Wales: I know the word but think of it as <I>wook wooks</I>), the sticks, the <I>tea tree</I> and <I>the cactus</I> some semantic differentiation is not impossible. It must be pointed out that my meaning for <I>up the boo-ay</I> is already supplied by <I>up the chute</I>, however.

At first sight it appeared that the production differences between open and woolly-faced sheep may be aimply due to wool blindness. Growth rate of woolly-faced lambs appeared to fall behind that of open-faced lambs in adverse weather.

The shed, a large building of corrugated iron, was surrounded outside by innumerable pens, most of them crowded with sheep packed as close as they could stand. Inside, the woolshed was also filled with penned sheep, except at the end where the wool-press stood, and along each side, where space was left for the shearers.

The word illustrates the lack of standardization in these seldom written words: I would have spelt it <I>wopcacker</I>. Baker records the word as <I>whopcacker</I> but gives a slightly variant meaning, as `very good', `bonzer', `snitcher', `rumptydooler', and the many synonyms of these words.

This seems to me a commoner meaning for <I>boo-ay</I> than `backblocks', `remote rural districts', mentioned by Keith Sinclair, in the <I>Pelican History of New Zealand</I>, with suggested derivation from the settlement at Puhoi. Since the backblocks are already called the <I>woop woops</I> (the form given by Partridge who says it is mainly restricted to New South Wales: I know the word but think of it as <I>wook wooks), the sticks, the tea tree</I> and <i>the cactus</i> some semantic differentiation is not impossible.

The name is derived from the fact that in those days a sailor had a month's wages advanced to him before leaving Port. As he invariably spent it, he called the first four weeks at sea `working off a dead horse', and the end of the term was signalised by the heaving overboard, with muchceremony, of an effigy of the defunct equine.

Quote: The passing of the first month [at sea in the  Westminster in 1842] brought the sailors' ceremony of `burying the dead horse'. When engaged, the men received one month's pay in advance to enable them to outfit themselves. Few would have much left, so for the first month they felt themselves to be working for nothing, or `working a dead horse' which must now be buried.  An equine effigy was placed on a wooden frame with four wheels, and amid loud singing was drawn around the deck three times by sailors dressed as policemen bearing staves of sailcloth filled with straw, hats of the same material and whiskers and long wigs of white yarn. The `horse' was put up for auction (the money being for liquor afterwards) and was then hoisted to the main yard-arm mounted by a sailor, during another chorus. Duly hoisted with this ceremony the `horse' was set alight by a long squib, the rope was cut, and the `poor oldman' (as the song went) fell into the sea. Thus was the dead horse buried. [Possibly from William Harris's MS Journal of a voyage; or John Newland diary from 1841.]

Quote: Regarding the origin of the term `Wowser' discussed in this column, `F.M.' writes:- `During the latter part of the last century a crusade was launched by the Women's Christian Temperance Union against the social evils in Australia. One woman who spoke always had a ready answer to the jeers and jibes of her audience. On one occasion when she and her party were accused of being `kill-joys' she retorted `We only want social evils removed'. The initial letters of those words were taken up by her opponents, and `wowser' became a term of opprobrium which has continued to the present time'.

Quote: "Wowser" is a word unique to New Zealand and Australia. It is a word rapidly passing into extinction, because the type of person it describes - someone who is implacably opposed to alcohol and, by implication, to hedonistic indulgence of any kind - is also dying out. As the once-powerful temperance movement fades into history and a new generation of New Zealanders grows up accustomed to the civilised pleasures of a deregulated liquor industry, "wowser" is a word that seems to belong in the 50s.

I was the first man to publicly use the word. I first gave it utterance in the City Council [Sydney?], when I applied it to Alderman Waterhouse, whom I referred to - I hope and believe with perfect good humor, and without gall or guile-as `the white, woolly, weary, wayery, word-wasting wowser from Waverley.' I am proud of my invention. The fabrication of such a word - absolutely absent from, but as absolutely required in our local vernacular until I invented and introduced it - was a stroke of genius, done on the spur of the moment, impromptu, the result of a divine or diabolical inspiration. Therefore, `Palmam qui meruit ferat' - the motto of Lord Nelson. Let it be the motto of John Norton in the circumstances of this case and for the purposes of establishing his claim to immortal glory as the inventor of the word Wowser.

The following definitions given to the author by bushmen themselves may help the reader to understand what a Colonial means when he uses the word. It may mean:- 1) `A man who tries to rob a bloke of his beer and pleasure' - therefore especially applicable to the temperance reformer.2) `A bloke who wears out the knees of his pants on Sundays praying, and another part of his pants all the week backsliding' - i.e. a hypocrite. 3) `Any sky-pilot, priest, or local preacher who makes a bloke uncomfortable, and pretends to be religious.'

Quote: What does Jones think about the technique advocated at some seminars and known as "wrapping"? Wrapping.. involves real estate investors giving loans to people to whom the bank refuses a loan. "The wrappers generally charge up to 20 per cent above the market value for a home. So if a home [19] is worth $100,000, the wrapper will sell it for $120,000. Then they charge much higher interest rate than the bank, some as high as 21 per cent."... "We don't promote wrapping at all, the reason being that the New Zealand Mortgage Brokers Association is very negative towards wrapping properties."
